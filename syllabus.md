## 2. Course Description and Learning Objectives

Programming for Cognitive Science has three primary learning objectives:

- to learn what computer programming is and what one can accomplish using computer programs
- to master the basics of how to write computer programs in the Python programming language, including its syntax and proper
  programming technique and style
- to discuss how computer programs, models, and simulations contribute to research about brain and cognitive science.

## 3. Course Requirements and Grading

### Grading Scale

- A: 90 and above
- B: 80-89.999
- C: 70-79.999
- D: 60-69.999
- F: Below 60
  <br>+/- grades are not given in this class.

### Grade Components

- Labs: 45%
- Homework: 30%
- Final Project: 20%
- Participation and Attendance: 5%
- Bonus Points for Final Project: up to 2% plus possible extension (individual action)
- Bonus Points for Course Feedback: up to 2% (collective action)

I am aware that the above numbers add up to 104%; the bonus points are explained in greater detail below.

### Labs — 45%

Each week we will be spending a considerable portion of our lab time working on various lab exercises. Each lab
assignment is one of the final sections of each chapter in the textbook. Lab assignments should be turned in each week
on the course website. Labs are due each week on Friday at 5pm. They can be turned in by Monday at 5pm for a 20%
deduction. After Monday at 5pm, they will not be accepted unless you have made prior arrangements.

### Homework — 30%

There are four homework assignments throughout the semester, about every three weeks. The homework assignments involve
creating a single, more complex Python program that achieves some BCOG-related goals. Homework assignments should be
turned in each week on the course website. These homework assignments are due on a Monday at 5pm, and 10% is deducted
for each day they are late.

### Final Project — 20%

The final project will involve creating a Python program that is more complex, like the homework assignments, but on a
topic of your own choosing. We will discuss the details later. At the end of the semester, you will turn in your code
and a brief project report which describes your project. For the project, you may work alone or in a group. The bigger
the group, the higher the expectations for your project.

XXX More info on final project goes here — Check Jaime's notes on Canvas for more details XXX

### Participation and Attendance — 5%

Participation and attendance is 5% of your grade. This includes being present for lab, participating in discussions, and
coming to office hours.

### Bonus Points for Final Project — up to 2% (plus possible extension)

You will have two opportunities to earn bonus points for your final projects, both related to peer review. You will
receive 1 point of extra credit for submitting the project early in order to solicit peer feedback. Additionally, you
will receive 1 more point of extra credit if you provide peer feedback to at least two other randomly selected projects
from the class. Lastly, anyone who completes _both_ of these tasks will receive an automatic extension of the final
project due date until May 19th.

### Bonus Points for Course Feedback — up to 2%

I will solicit anonymous, honest feedback from you throughout the semester, both formally and informally. In order to
incentivize your participation, I am offering a collective reward for the class — an additional 2% toward _all_ of your
final grades — under one condition. **I will distribute this bonus to the whole class if, and only if, at least 75% of
the class submits feedback for the course.** If less than 75% of the class participates, then no one receives any bonus
(so submitting feedback can only help you, and can never hurt you). It is important to me that you are honest in this
feedback. This bonus is a class-wide incentive to help develop the course, its content, my own abilities as an
instructor, and to generally improve the course for everyone, including future students.

## 4. Academic Integrity Policy

This class will take the University's Academic Integrity policy very seriously. Cheating and other forms of academic
dishonesty will not be tolerated. The University of Illinois has the responsibility of maintaining academic integrity so
as to protect the quality of education and research on our campus and to protect those who depend upon our integrity. It
is the responsibility of each student to refrain from infractions of academic integrity, from conduct that may lead to
suspicion of such infractions, and from conduct that aids others in such infractions. It is also the responsibility of
the student to know and understand what constitutes academic integrity infractions. Ignorance is not a valid excuse. The
University's official statement of a student's responsibilities can be found here:
[http://admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/article1_part4_1-401.html](http://admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/article1_part4_1-401.html).
More information about the University's academic integrity policy, and what constitutes an infraction, can be found
here: [http://www.las.illinois.edu/students/integrity/](http://www.las.illinois.edu/students/integrity/).

## 5. Accommodation Policy

To obtain disability-related academic adjustments and/or auxiliary aids, students with disabilities must contact the
course instructor and the Disability Resources and Educational Services (DRES) as soon as possible. To contact DRES, you
may visit 1207 S. Oak St., Champaign, call 333-4603, e-mail disability@illinois.edu, or go to the DRES website
([https://www.disability.illinois.edu](https://www.disability.illinois.edu)). If you are concerned you have a
disability-related condition that is impacting your academic progress, there are academic screening appointments
available on campus that can help diagnose a previously undiagnosed disability by visiting the DRES website and
selecting "Sign-Up for an Academic Screening" at the bottom of the page.
