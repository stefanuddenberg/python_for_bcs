## 2. Course Description and Learning Objectives

Programming for Cognitive Science has three primary learning objectives:

- to learn what computer programming is and what one can accomplish using computer programs
- to master the basics of how to write computer programs in the Python programming language,
  including its syntax and proper programming technique and style
- to discuss how computer programs, models, and simulations contribute to research about brain and
  cognitive science.

## 3. Course Requirements and Grading

### Grading Scale

- A: 90 and above
- B: 80-89.999
- C: 70-79.999
- D: 60-69.999
- F: Below 60
  <br>+/- grades are not given in this class.

### Grade Components

- Labs: 40%
- Homework: 30%
- Final Project: 20%
- Participation: 10%
- Bonus Points for Final Project: up to 2% plus possible extension (individual action)
- Bonus Points for Course Feedback: up to 2% (collective action)

I am aware that the above numbers add up to 104%; the bonus points are explained in greater detail below.

### Labs — 40%

Each week we will be spending a considerable portion of our lab time working on various lab
exercises. Each lab assignment is one of the final sections of each chapter in the textbook. Lab
assignments should be turned in each week on the course website. Labs are due each week on Friday at
11:59pm. They can be turned in by the following Monday at 11:59pm for a 20% deduction. After Monday
at 11:59pm, they will not be accepted unless you have made prior arrangements.

### Homework — 30%

There are four homework assignments throughout the semester, about every three weeks. The homework
assignments involve creating a single, more complex Python program that achieves some BCOG-related
goals. Homework assignments should be turned in via Canvas on weeks where they are due. These
homework assignments are due on Monday at 11:59pm, and 10% is deducted for each day they are late.

### Final Project — 20%

The final project will involve creating a Python program that is more complex, like the homework assignments, but on a
topic of your own choosing. We will discuss the details later. At the end of the semester, you will turn in your code
and a brief project report which describes your project. For the project, you may work alone or in a group. The bigger
the group, the higher the expectations for your project.

You can learn more about the final project [here](bcog_200_final_project_assignment.md).

### Participation — 10%

In-class participation accounts for 10% of your grade. This includes completing "check
your knowledge" quizzes, being present for class, completing class activities, asking and answering
questions in class, and coming to office hours. As such, while your presence is necessary, it is not
sufficient for participation. And though not required, you are encouraged to make use of office
hours to discuss assignments, the final project, or anything else related to the course/research in
general.

One of the primary ways that you will participate in class is by completing "check your knowledge"
quizzes towards the start of each class using iClicker. These quizzes are designed to help you
solidify your understanding of the material that you encountered in the textbook. Be not afraid:
these quizzes are graded pass/fail, so you will not lose points for getting any answers wrong.
Instead, they are designed to be diagnostic, to help you identify which (if any) concepts you may
not fully understand. Alas, it is not possible to make up for missed quizzes, so you are strongly
encouraged to attend class regularly and to come prepared to participate each day.

Please understand that we will be using iClickers in every class. It is your responsibility to come
prepared to participate in a functioning remote (or mobile phone with the iClicker application
installed) every class period. Note that it is a violation of the University's academic integrity
policy to use an iClicker that is not your own.

### Bonus Points for Final Project — up to 2% (plus possible extension)

You will have two opportunities to earn bonus points for your final projects, both related to peer
review. You will receive 1 point of extra credit for submitting the project early in order to
solicit peer feedback. Additionally, you will receive 1 more point of extra credit if you provide
peer feedback to at least two other randomly selected projects from the class. Lastly, anyone who
completes _both_ of these tasks will receive an automatic extension of the final project due date
until May 16th.

### Bonus Points for Course Feedback — up to 2%

I will solicit anonymous, honest feedback from you throughout the semester, both formally and
informally. In order to incentivize your participation, I am offering a collective reward for the
class — an additional 2% toward _all_ of your final grades — under one condition. **I will
distribute this bonus to the whole class if, and only if, at least 75% of the class submits feedback
for the course.** If less than 75% of the class participates, then no one receives any bonus (so
submitting feedback can only help you, and can never hurt you). It is important to me that you are
honest in this feedback. This bonus is a class-wide incentive to help develop the course, its
content, my own abilities as an instructor, and to generally improve the course for everyone,
including future students.

## 4. Academic Integrity Policy

This class will take the University's Academic Integrity policy very seriously. Cheating and other
forms of academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. The University of Illinois has the
responsibility of maintaining academic integrity so as to protect the quality of education and
research on our campus and to protect those who depend upon our integrity. It is the responsibility
of each student to refrain from infractions of academic integrity, from conduct that may lead to
suspicion of such infractions, and from conduct that aids others in such infractions. It is also the
responsibility of the student to know and understand what constitutes academic integrity
infractions. Ignorance is not a valid excuse. The University's official statement of a student's
responsibilities can be found here:
[https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-401](https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-401).
More information about the University's academic integrity policy, and what constitutes an
infraction, can be found here:
[https://www.las.illinois.edu/students/integrity/](https://www.las.illinois.edu/students/integrity/).

### AI Policy

It is becoming increasingly common for programmers to use AI tools to help them write code. This is
not so dangerous for an experienced coder who (hopefully) understands both the benefits and dangers
of these tools. However, it is likely outright harmful for a beginner who is just learning how to
program. Imagine trying to learn how to ride a bicycle for the first time, but instead of struggling
with an actual bicycle, falling, getting bruised, developing a sense of balance, etc., you're
instead "training" by sitting on a self-driving tricycle with unreliable GPS and a tendency to go
off-road. I am especially concerned by how these tools can reduce one's ability to debug program
behavior and think critically about whether the code you are writing accomplishes your goals
correctly.

While I don't want to discourage you from using AI assistants writ large, I do want you to be
transparent and thoughtful in your use of such tools. So, I ask that you keep in mind the
distinction between "learning" vs. "doing" as you go through this course:

- You may use AI tools to help you _learn_ how to program. For example, you can ask large language
  models (LLMs, like ChatGPT) to explain core coding concepts to you in ways that you might find
  digestible, or to help you understand why your code threw a particular error. One such tool is
  Harvard's CS50 class's [Rubber Duck Debugging AI](https://cs50.ai/chat). The virtual duck asks
  questions to help you understand what's going on in your code (a la ["Rubber Duck
  Debugging"](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/)). It is unlikely to hamper your learning and may
  even help. ChatGPT itself now has a "Study and Learn" mode that may be useful to you as well.
- You may _not_ use AI tools to _do_ (or complete) any of your assignments. This means that you
  mustn't ask a chatbot to write code for you (e.g., "Write me a function that returns the sum of
  squares of a list of numbers") and you mustn't copy and paste code directly from a large language
  model or other AI system into an assignment as your own.

**Transparency requirement**: If you do use AI tools to help you learn, I ask that you please be
transparent about it. For example, if you use a chatbot to help you understand a concept, you might
write at the top of your code something like:

> I used ChatGPT to help me understand recursion. Here is the conversation that I had:
> [Insert link to conversation or summary of conversation here]

If, however, you fail to be transparent in your use of the tools, or use an AI tool to literally
_do_ your assignments for you, then you will have violated the academic integrity policy. Such
violations will result in a grade of zero for the relevant assignment and may be referred to the
University's academic integrity office for further review.

It bears repeating: your work must be your own. We are not in the business of grading ChatGPT's
homework, which would always receive a grade of zero.

## 5. Accommodation Policy

To obtain disability-related academic adjustments and/or auxiliary aids, students with disabilities
must contact the course instructor and the Disability Resources and Educational Services (DRES) as
soon as possible. To contact DRES, you may visit 1207 S. Oak St., Champaign, call 333-4603, e-mail
disability@illinois.edu, or go to the DRES website
([https://www.disability.illinois.edu](https://www.disability.illinois.edu)). If you are concerned
you have a disability-related condition that is impacting your academic progress, there are academic
screening appointments available on campus that can help diagnose a previously undiagnosed
disability by visiting the DRES website and selecting "Sign-Up for an Academic Screening" at the
bottom of the page.
