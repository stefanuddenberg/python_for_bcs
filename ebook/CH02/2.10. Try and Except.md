# 2.10. Try and except

When writing Python code, errors (also called _exceptions_) can occur for many reasons: trying to
divide by zero, accessing a list index that doesn't exist, or attempting to convert an invalid
string to a number (e.g., "123" is valid, but "123a" is not). Instead of letting these errors crash
our program, we can handle them gracefully using `try` and `except` blocks.

## Basic try-except structure

Here's the basic structure of a try-except block. The code in the `try` block is the code that is
"risky" in some sense: it might raise an exception. The code in the `except` block is the code that
runs if an exception occurs.

```python
try:
    # Code that might raise an exception (in this case it definitely will)
    result = 10 / 0
except:
    # Code that runs if an exception occurs
    print("An error occurred!")
```

The above code will print "An error occurred!" because we wrote code that results in a classic
"division by zero" error.

But let's look at a more practical example. Imagine we want to convert user input to a number, but
the user enters something that isn't (and could never be considered) a number.

```python
try:
    user_input = input("Enter a number: ")
    number = int(user_input)
    print(f"Your number doubled is: {number * 2}")
except:
    print("That wasn't a valid number!")
```

If the user enters something like "hello", the program will not crash because we have a `try` and
`except` block. Instead, the program will print "That wasn't a valid number!" because we wrote
code that results in a "value error" — the user entered a string when we were expecting an integer.

Note that if the user entered a decimal number, the program would still crash because it is
represented as a _string_ at first. (We could use the `float()` function to convert the string to a
decimal number first before trying to convert it to an integer.)

## Catching specific exceptions with multiple `except` clauses

While catching all exceptions with a bare `except` clause works, it's generally better to handle
each type of exception separately. This allows us to handle different types of errors differently depending on the context.

```python
try:
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / number
except ValueError: # will occur if, for example, the user enters a string
    print("That's not a valid number!")
except ZeroDivisionError: # will occur if the user enters 0
    print("You can't divide by zero!")
```

You can have as many `except` clauses as you need to handle different types of errors.

## The `else` and `finally` clauses

Try-except blocks can also include `else` and `finally` clauses:

- `else` runs if no exception occurs — think of it as "if no error, then do this"
- `finally` runs whether an exception occurs or not — think of it as "do this no matter what at the end"

```python
try:
    number = int(input("Enter a positive number: "))
    if number < 0:
        raise ValueError("Number must be positive")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
else:
    print(f"You entered the valid number: {number}")
finally:
    print("Thank you for using this program!")
```

## Using try-except wisely

While try-except blocks are undoubtedly powerful, they should be used judiciously. Here are some rules of thumb:

1. Only catch exceptions you can handle meaningfully; don't use it as a crutch to handle normal flow control
2. Avoid using bare `except` clauses (without specifying the exception type) — explicit is better than implicit, after all.
3. Keep the code in the `try` block focused on the operations that might raise exceptions
