# 0.0 How to Succeed in This Course

Welcome! This course is meant to empower you with programming skills to accomplish research goals as
a cognitive scientist. The first half of the course is essentially an introduction to the Python
programming language, while the second half guides you through various research applications
thereof.

Alas, this is not a typical lecture course. Knowledge is not poured into you via Powerpoint slides
and then expected to be regurgitated on-demand in exams. Rather, this is a _skill-focused course_:
you ingest information outside of class hours (hence the online textbook) and then deliberately
practice what you have learnt during class hours via guided exercises, with the overarching goal of
cultivating mastery over a fickle sort of applied creative logic (i.e., programming).

## Why Learn to Program

There are myriad skills one can learn in this life — sailing, skiing, singing, and so forth — but
some are more essential than others when it comes to navigating society or joining the workforce.
For example, our society heavily values literacy (basic reading and writing skills) and numeracy
(basic math skills), so we spend many years in compulsory education drilling these abilities into
children. Programming, or coding, is something like a blend between these two important skillsets,
akin to a mix between creative writing and brute mathematical logic. It is also a skill that is
becoming increasingly important over time. Some would argue that, with the advent of advanced
artificial intelligence techniques, programming will become less important, to the point that
software development jobs will disappear. I disagree — if anything, AI will only make _more_
important to be able to program as it is incorporated in some way into more and more jobs. After
all, ubiquitous text-to-speech and word processing technologies have not obviated literacy. On the
contrary, they have made reading and writing _even more_ useful skills to have in one's arsenal, as
they allow you to operate with more flexibility and efficiency than ever before. So, too, is it with
coding — even a little knowledge of programming can go a long way towards increasing your
capabilities, including within roles that are not traditionally believed to involve software
development. I believe that anyone, anywhere, in any job — be they middle managers, HR
practitioners, librarians, artists, and so on — can benefit from knowing how to leverage logic to
achieve their ends, in much the same way that everyone can benefit from knowing how to read, write,
and do basic arithmetic.

Today, the fruits of programming can be seen all around you. From critical banking infrasture that
allows you to transfer money within seconds; to clever phone games that delight millions of users;
to the cutting edge science that we perform at the university — all of it is made possible by typing
simple logical statements into our computers. By the end of this course, you, too, will be able to
create little miracles with the application of elbow grease!

There are many ways to program, and many languages with which you can bring your visions to life.
This course is specifically designed to help train you in the ways of scientific computing using
what is arguably the most powerful and commonly used language within the field today — Python. As an
added bonus, this language is pluripotent. You can run with it in almost any direction you choose,
from web development to finance, and its syntax is simple enough that it acts as a great "gateway"
language; learning other languages becomes easier once you know this one. But first, how can we best
learn the language (and thereby succeed in this course) in the first place?

## Helpful Strategies

Programming is a skill that requires consistent practice and engagement. Based on past experience
teaching this course, students who excel share several key behaviors. Here's what will help you:

## Read the Material Before Class

Students who consistently read the assigned material before coming to class have significant advantages —

- **Familiarity with concepts**: When you've already encountered the ideas, class time becomes an
  opportunity for training and reinforcement rather than introduction. Reading the material during
  class is _not_ a good use of time.
- **More productive questions**: Pre-reading allows you to identify what you don't understand and
  ask specific questions.
- **More time for practice**: You can focus on the exercises and practice, practice, practice rather
  than trying to learn the concepts from square one.

Even if you don't fully understand everything you read, exposure to the concepts beforehand will
give you time to digest them and ask better questions during class.

## Start Assignments Early

The most successful students in this course:

- **Begin assignments immediately** after they're assigned, _not_ the day before they're due
- **Work incrementally** on assignments over multiple days
- **Embrace the "get something working" approach** rather than trying to write perfect code from the start
- **Have time to ask for help** when they encounter problems

Programming assignments often take longer than you expect — even when you account for the fact that
they take longer than you expect! Start early to avoid last-minute stress.

## Take Good Notes

Although I have written a lot for you here, you will have to do some writing, too. **Take notes!**
Active note-taking significantly improves retention and understanding.

- **Write code samples** in your notes. If you don't like to take notes digitally, that's okay;
  write them by hand.
- **Document error messages** you encounter and how you fixed them. Keep a record of your debugging
  process.
- **Create your own examples** of concepts to ensure you understand them.
- **Maintain a personal "cheat sheet"** of syntax and commands you find useful. We often call these
  "snippets" in programming.

Your notes should focus on what you find confusing or want to remember, not just copying what's
presented.

## Experiment Constantly

Programming is a _skill_. It is learned by _doing_, not just reading or watching. You can't learn to sing,
swim, skate, or ski just by watching YouTube videos, and programming is the same way. As a rule of thumb: for
every _one_ hour you spend reading this textbook, watching YouTube videos, or otherwise passively consuming
programming content, you should spend at least _three or four_ hours actively coding. You don't have to code
for multiple hours all at once, but it helps to code in chunks of at least 1 hour in length, because it takes
time to get into the flow.

- **Try variations** of example code to see what happens. Under most circumstances you can't really
  break your computer, so don't be afraid to experiment.
- **Break things deliberately** to better understand error messages.
- **Build small test programs** to isolate concepts you're struggling with.
- **Combine different concepts** to create something new.

The most efficient way to learn programming is to spend time actively coding, making mistakes, and
fixing them. Embrace the struggle!

## Ask Questions Strategically

When you get stuck:

1. **Try to solve it yourself first** — this builds problem-solving skills
2. **Be specific** about what you've tried and what isn't working
3. **Prepare code examples** that demonstrate your problem, stating the expected outcome, what the current (failed)
   outcome is, and any hypotheses you have about what might be going wrong.
4. **Read error messages carefully** — they often tell you exactly what's wrong.

Remember that being confused is perfectly normal when learning programming. Asking good questions is a skill that
distinguishes successful programmers.

## Collaborate Appropriately

Working with others can accelerate your learning!

- **Explain concepts to classmates** — teaching reinforces your own understanding
- **Discuss approaches** to solving problems (without sharing code directly)
- **Form study groups** to review material together

However, ensure all work you submit represents your own understanding. Simply copying someone else's
(or, worse yet, an _AI's_) solution deprives you of the learning experience, and leaves you dependent
on others. Just as you wouldn't want to rely on text-to-speech programs to read the product labels
at the grocery aisle, refrain from relying on the machine to do your programming for you.

## Maintain a Growth Mindset

> 七転び八起き  
> Fall down seven times, get up eight times  
> — Japanese proverb

Programming can be challenging, but:

- **Everyone struggles** at first — this is normal and expected. I was _horrendous_ at programming
  when I first started.
- **Errors are learning opportunities**, not failures
- **Skills improve with practice** — what seems impossible to you now can routine, if not automatic
- **Focus on progress**, not perfection

Remember that professional programmers spend much of their time debugging and learning new things.
And even if you've spent many years programming, you will still struggle, turning to Google, Stack
Overflow, and even AI for help (albeit responsibly). The struggle is part of the process for
everyone, not just beginners.
