# 0.8 Editor setup guide

In this section, we'll walk through the process of setting up various potential editors for this course. Here I'm
starting with VS Code, but you can use other editors if you prefer.

## Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a powerful, free text editor made by Microsoft. It provides excellent Python support and
is packed with helpful features that will make coding easier.

### Installing VS Code

1. Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Click the big blue "Download" button - it should automatically detect your operating system (e.g. "Download for
   Windows", "Download for Mac")
3. Once downloaded, run the installer:
   - **Windows**: Run the downloaded `.exe` file and follow the installation prompts
   - **Mac**: Open the downloaded `.dmg` file, and drag the Visual Studio Code icon to your Applications folder. Eject
     the disk image after installation.
   - **Linux**: Follow the package installation instructions for your distribution

### Adding VS Code to Your PATH

Being able to open VS Code from the terminal using the `code` command is extremely useful. Here's how to set it up:

1. Open VS Code
2. Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>
   (Windows/Linux) to open the Command Palette
3. Type "shell command" to search, and select "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH"
4. Restart your terminal so that the installation takes effect

You can test if it worked by opening your terminal and typing:

```bash
code --version
```

If you see a version number, the installation was successful! You can now use commands like `code .` to open VS Code in
the current directory, or `code myfile.py` to open a specific file.

### Essential Extensions

VS Code becomes more powerful with extensions. You can install extensions using the Extensions view, which you can
access by clicking the Extensions icon in the left sidebar (it looks like four squares, with three of the squares making
an L-shape, and the top right square coming away from the rest) or pressing <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>
/ <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> while the sidebar is focused. Once in the Extensions view, you can
search for extensions by typing in the search bar at the top of the view.

#### Python Extension

1. Enter the Extensions view
2. Search for "Python"
3. Install the official Python extension by Microsoft (it should be the first result, and it will have a blue checkmark
   icon next to "Microsoft" as the publisher)

#### Black formatter

Black is a code formatter that automatically makes your Python code consistent and readable. This will save you a lot of
heartache in the future! Once your code is written correctly, you can use the Black formatter to automatically format it
whenever you save the file.

1. Open the Extensions sidebar again
2. Search for "Black Formatter"
3. Install the Black Formatter extension (again, from Microsoft â€” frustratingly, it's the third result for me, with over
   4 million installations)

To set up Black as your default Python formatter:

1. Open the Command Palette
2. Search for "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)"
3. Add these lines to your settings:

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true
}
```

Note that these settings use JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), not Python. This means that the settings file needs to
have one curly brace at the beginning, one at the end, and your options are a series of key-value pairs, with commas at
the end of the line if you have multiple entries. Keys are strings in double quotes (single quotes are not allowed!),
and values can be strings, numbers, or booleans (lower-case `true` and `false` are used in JavaScript, unlike in Python
where `True` and `False` are used). If in doubt, you can copy and paste the above code into your settings.

### Using the Command Palette

As a powerful text editor, there are many, many commands you can use in VS Code. It is impossible to remember them all.
When you need to find a command, the Command Palette is your go-to tool. In fact, we've already used it earlier to
install the `code` command to your computer's PATH. You can access the command palette with:

- Mac: <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>
- Windows/Linux: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>

Some useful commands to try:

- Type "Python: Select Interpreter" to choose your Python version (if you're using conda, you can select your `bcog200`
  environment, for example)
- Type "Format Document" to manually format your code
- Type "Terminal: Create New Terminal" to open a terminal inside VS Code

> [!TIP]
> You can use the Command Palette to discover new features. Just start typing what you want to do, and VS Code will show you matching commands!

### Verifying your setup

Let's make sure everything is working:

1. Open VS Code
2. Create a new file called `test.py`
3. Add this code:

```python
def greet( name):
    print( f"Hello, {name}!"  )

greet("World")
```

4. Save the file
5. The code should automatically format (removing the extra spaces)
6. You should see Python syntax highlighting
7. If you hover over Python code, you should see type hints and documentation

If all of these work, your VS Code setup is ready for some productive programming!
