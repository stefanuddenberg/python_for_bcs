# 0.3. Installing a Text Editor

In order to do any serious programming, you will need a **text editor**. As the name implies, this
is a program that allows you to edit text. Of course, you have likely edited text many times before
in your life, using programs such as Microsoft Word or Google Docs, or perhaps one of the basic
editors that come installed on computers today (e.g., Notepad, TextEdit). However, none of these
applications are suitable for programming. This is because files created and edited with these
applications include information that is invisible to you, but used by the text editor to keep track
of formatting, font information, and all kinds of other ancillary things. With that in mind, we are
going to need to download a program that doesn't have this esoteric issue. As a plus, many text
editors are made specifically for writing computer programs and include all manner of features that
help you along the way, like syntax highlighting (e.g., coloring the text depending on whether it is
a keyword in the programming language) or automatic error detection. In the next section, 
([0.4. Text Editing Software](0.4.%20Text%20Editing%20Software.md)) we will describe a few different
options for text editors and their pros and cons, so you can pick the one you want to use. But for
now, we will pick a reasonable option to get started.

A basic (and free!) text editor is always a great program to have, even if you decide to use one
with more advanced features later. So for this, we are going to start with Visual Studio Code (VS
Code). VS Code is free and open-source, developed by Microsoft with contributions from the developer
community.

### Installing VS Code

1. Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Click the big blue "Download" button - it should automatically detect your operating system (e.g. "Download for
   Windows", "Download for Mac")
3. Once downloaded, run the installer:
   - **Windows**: Run the downloaded `.exe` file and follow the installation prompts
   - **Mac**: Open the downloaded `.dmg` file, and drag the Visual Studio Code icon to your Applications folder. Eject
     the disk image after installation. **DO NOT SIMPLY KEEP THE DISK IMAGE MOUNTED FOREVER**
   - **Linux**: Follow the package installation instructions for your distribution

### Adding VS Code to Your PATH

Being able to open VS Code from the terminal using the `code` command is extremely useful. You can
set it up like so:

1. Open VS Code
2. Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>
   (Windows/Linux) to open the Command Palette
3. Type "shell command" to search, and select "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH"
4. Restart your terminal so that the installation takes effect

You can test if it worked by opening your terminal and typing:

```bash
code --version
```

If you see a version number, the installation was successful! You can now use commands like `code .`
to open VS Code in the current directory, or `code myfile.py` to open your specific file (again, not
the use of a placeholder).

> [!NOTE] 
> #### What is the PATH?
> Think of the PATH as your computer's address book. When you want to run a program like Python or
> VS Code or anything else from the terminal or command line, your computer looks to the PATH first
> to figure out where that command or file lives. All important programs accessible via the command
> line must be indexed in your PATH. For the purposes of this course, you shouldn't have to worry
> too much about the PATH, but if you do run into any PATH issues, simply ask us for help in class
> or at office hours.
> 
> Note well: here we are talking
> about the **PATH**, all upper case — when we speak of "paths" or "a path" or a "file path" we are simply referring to the exact location(s) of files or folders. PATH != "path"

### Essential Extensions

One of the best features of VS Code is its extensibility. You can install extensions using the
Extensions menu, which you can access by clicking the Extensions icon in the left sidebar (it looks
like four squares, with three of the squares making an L-shape, and the top right square floating
away from the rest, up and to the right) or pressing <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> /
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> while the sidebar is focused. Once in the Extensions
menu, you can search for extensions by typing in the search bar at the top of the menu.

#### Python Extension

1. Enter the Extensions menu
2. Search for "Python"
3. Install the official Python extension by Microsoft (it should be the first result, and it will have a blue checkmark
   icon next to "Microsoft" as the publisher)

#### Black formatter

Black is a code formatter that automatically makes your Python code consistent and readable. This
will save you a lot of heartache in the future! Once your code is written correctly, you can use the
Black formatter to automatically format it whenever you save the file.

1. Open the Extensions sidebar again
2. Search for "Black Formatter"
3. Install the Black Formatter extension (again, from Microsoft — frustratingly, it's the third result for me, with over
   4 million installations)

To set up Black as your default Python formatter:

1. Open the Command Palette
2. Search for "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)"
3. Add these lines to your settings:

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true
}
```

Note that these settings use JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), not Python. This means that the settings file needs to
have one curly brace at the beginning, one at the end, and your options are a series of key-value pairs, with commas at
the end of the line if you have multiple entries. Keys are strings in double quotes (single quotes are not allowed!),
and values can be strings, numbers, or booleans (lower-case `true` and `false` are used in JavaScript, unlike in Python
where `True` and `False` are used). If in doubt, you can copy and paste the above code into your settings.

### Other Useful Extensions

There are myriad extensions on offer, so I won't go into all of them. However, two that I have found
useful are Rainbow CSV (which makes it easier to read and edit CSV files in the editor) and
indent-rainbow (which makes it easier to spot indentation). Feel free to install those if you like.

### Using the Command Palette

As a powerful text editor, there are many, many commands you can use in VS Code. It is impossible to
remember them all. When you need to find a command, the Command Palette is your go-to tool. In fact,
we've already used it earlier to install the `code` command to your computer's PATH. You can access
the command palette with:

- Mac: <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>
- Windows/Linux: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>

Some useful commands to try:

- Type "Python: Select Interpreter" to choose your Python version (if you're using conda, you can select your `bcog200`
  environment, for example)
- Type "Format Document" to manually format your code
- Type "Terminal: Create New Terminal" to open a terminal inside VS Code

> [!TIP]
> You can use the Command Palette to discover new features. Just start typing what you want to do, and VS Code will show you matching commands!

### Verifying your setup

Let's make sure everything is working:

1. Open VS Code
2. Create a new file called `test.py`
3. Add this code:

```python
def greet( name):
    print( f"Hello, {name}!"  )

greet("World")
```

4. Save the file
5. The code should automatically format (removing the extra, unnecessary spaces) and look like this instead:

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("World")
```

1. You should see Python syntax highlighting, with text colored differently depending on their meaning
2. If you hover over Python code (e.g., the print command), you should see type hints and documentation

If all of these work, your VS Code setup is ready for some productive programming!
