# 0.4 Text Editing Software

As we have already described, text editors are the way that you create code for Python and other
programming languages. Editors exist on a continuum from very basic to extremely complex. Some
editors are very basic, like Sublime Text, and are nice and an easy way to get started. Others (e.g.
PyCharm) are extremely complex — sometimes called Integrated Development Environments (or IDEs),
they provide a bunch of additional features. In this section, we are going to go over some features
of VS Code (which is a happy medium between those two extremes) and then describe some of the
alternatives.

You don't need to read this section right away if you are happy enough with VS Code. But it's here if and when you
are interested.

## Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free, open-source, and highly popular code editor developed by
Microsoft. It balances being lightweight (like Sublime Text) while providing a wide array of
IDE-like features (like PyCharm). I consider it an IDE-lite as a result. If you can dream it, there
is probably an extension for it, so you can tailor it to your needs.

### Features:

- **Extensive Extension Marketplace**: VS Code supports Python (and many other languages) via extensions, enabling
  everything from auto-completion to integrated Jupyter notebooks.
- **Built-in Git Integration**: Version control is built into the editor, making collaboration and source code
  management easier.
- **Debugging Tools**: VS Code includes a debugger with breakpoints, variable inspection, and call stack viewing.
- **Live Share**: You can use the "Live Share" extension to collaborate in real-time with others by sharing your
  development environment. This is a great feature for remote pair programming, akin to Google Docs for code.
- **Command Palette**: VS Code has a useful command palette you can use to search for the myriad
  commands available. Open it with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> (<kbd>CMD</kbd>
  + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> on Macs) and it will show you a list of commands that match your
  search.

VS Code is a popular choice among developers of all levels because of its flexibility, speed, and large extension
library. It's an excellent choice once you're comfortable with the basics. If using VS Code for this course, make sure
to install the Python extension, and to add the "code" command to your PATH so that you can open files in VS Code from
the terminal (e.g., `code .` to open the current directory in VS Code). This can be done by hitting <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +
<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> (<kbd>CMD</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> on Macs) to open the command palette
and searching for `shell command: install 'code' command`.

## Sublime Text

Sublime Text is a lightweight, fast, and highly customizable text editor that is great for beginners and professionals
alike. Its simple interface allows you to focus on writing code without distraction, while also offering useful features
like multiple cursors, split editing, and a command palette to quickly access functionality. Sublime Text supports a
wide variety of programming languages out of the box, including Python, and you can extend it with plugins as you become
more experienced.

### Features:

- **Speed**: Sublime Text is known for being incredibly responsive and lightweight.
- **Multiple Selections**: You can edit several lines or instances of text simultaneously.
- **Command Palette**: Quickly access editor commands via a drop-down search.
- **Extensibility**: It has a strong plugin ecosystem that lets you add linters, themes, and Python-specific tools.

While Sublime Text is free to use, it does ask you to purchase a license after a trial period (prompting you to do so
every time you open the editor), but this is optional.

## Atom

Atom is another free, open-source text editor developed by GitHub. It is highly customizable and designed to be
accessible for new coders while providing powerful features for experienced programmers. Atom is often considered a
"hackable" editor because it facilitates tweaking nearly everything about it.

### Features:

- **Built-in Git integration**: Atom has native support for version control using Git, making it easier to collaborate
  on projects.
- **Modular design**: You can modify its functionality using JavaScript, and Atom has a rich ecosystem of packages that
  allow you to add features, from syntax highlighting to linters.
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Despite its features, Atom is somewhat slower compared to other editors, especially when handling larger projects. From
my own experience, I tried Atom for a while, but I found typing on it felt sluggish.

## PyCharm

PyCharm is a full-fledged Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed specifically for Python development, created
by JetBrains. PyCharm offers a robust set of features right out of the box, including code analysis, a built-in
debugger, testing frameworks, and version control support.

### Features:

- **Intelligent Code Assistance**: PyCharm provides advanced code completion, error checking, and refactoring support tailored specifically for Python.
- **Debugger and Profiler**: PyCharm's debugging tools allow you to inspect variables and code flow as your program
  runs.
- **Project and Environment Management**: PyCharm simplifies working with virtual environments and managing
  dependencies.
- **Support for Web Development**: If you're interested in frameworks like FastAPI or Flask, PyCharm has built-in
  support.

PyCharm is best suited for intermediate to advanced users due to its complexity and resource usage. It comes in both a
free (Community) edition and a paid (Professional) edition with more features. I tried using PyCharm for a while, but I
found it to be too much editor for me — it felt like it was constantly reindexing all of my packages. Perhaps this issue
has been remedied in recent years, but I no longer use it.

## Anaconda Spyder

Spyder is an open-source IDE that comes bundled with the Anaconda distribution (one of the options I gave you for
installing Python in the first place). It is tailored for data science and comes with built-in tools for data
exploration, visualization, and debugging, making it a great choice if you are working in fields like statistics or
machine learning. The environment is somewhat similar to MATLAB, which is what I originally cut my teeth on as an
undergraduate and in my early years as a researcher.

### Features:

- **Variable Explorer**: Allows you to view and manipulate your variables in real-time as you run your code, similar to
  MATLAB.
- **Integrated IPython Console**: A powerful interactive Python shell is included within the IDE.
- **Scientific Libraries Support**: Spyder comes pre-configured to work with libraries like NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and
  Matplotlib.

While Spyder is a good option for data science, it lacks some of the more advanced features found in full-fledged IDEs
like PyCharm, and it can be slow for large-scale projects.

## Cursor

Cursor is a closed-source fork of VS Code that is centered around AI. It inherits all the costs and benefits of VS Code,
but it has some additional features that are centered around AI. For example, using an integrated sidebar, you can
directly chat with different AI models that are informed by your code base, or highlight code and prompt it to change
that code in some way. It's the editor I use daily, and I would recommend it to (almost) anyone writing code. However,
there are a few cons:

1. It is closed source.
2. It has a "freemium" model, with its professional features costing $20/month (less if you pay annually). The free
   edition is more or less the same as VS Code, but perhaps a smidge slower.
3. I do not think this level of AI assistance is good for beginners. It is good for more advanced coders who know what
   they are trying to achieve and can evaluate whether the AI's suggestions will help them get there. However, for
   beginners, I believe it would be better to learn without direct AI assistance while writing code, lest they become
   dependent on it and it hinder their learning of the fundamentals. I would recommend against using it until after you
   complete this course.
