# 0.3 Terminal Crash Course

As we said, the terminal is a text-based way for you to run apps, manipulate files, and give other commands to your
computer. All desktop and laptop computers have some kind of terminal installed by default. Most tablets do (except
iPads, but you can install one).

We've already gone over some of the basics of using the terminal, but here is a quick reference guide for some other
useful Terminal commands. As before, these commands are the same on both Mac and Windows unless otherwise noted.

### The file system

Your computer is organized into a _file system_, which is a hierarchical way of organizing files and directories
(folders). The file system is basically the same regardless of what operating system you are using (though Mac and Linux
use forward slashes `/` for paths while Windows uses backslashes `\`). Here are some useful commands for navigating your
file system. Most files have a _file extension_, which is a short string of characters that usually follows the file
name and tells you what type of file it is (e.g. `.txt`, `.docx`, `.png`, `.mp4`). This tells your computer what type of
program to use to open the file, and provides you with a clue as to what kind of content the file contains.

### Commands

In the terminal, you type commands to tell your computer what you want to do. When you press enter, the command is
executed. Commands are usually of the form `command argument1 argument2`, where `command` is the action you want to take,
and `argument1` and `argument2` are the inputs to the command. Some commands take no arguments, while others take one or
more arguments. Commands can also have optional flags, which are extra instructions that modify the behavior of the
command. Flags are usually preceded by a `-` (e.g. `-l`, `-h`, `-o`). These flags have meanings specific to the
command you are using. Sometimes there are more verbose versions of flags that are preceded by `--` (e.g. `--help`, `--output`, `--verbose`). You can always find the flags that a command accepts by typing `command --help` or `man command`.

### Basic navigation

Navigating your file system is one of the most basic skills you need to learn to use the terminal. Here are some
commands you will find helpful:

| Command                   | Description                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pwd`                     | Print working directory: tells you the path of the directory you are currently in.                                             |
| `ls` or `dir`             | List he files and directories in the directory you are currently in. Windows uses `dir` instead of `ls`.                       |
| `cd`                      | Change directory: allows you to move to a different directory.                                                                 |
| `cd ~`                    | Change directory to your home folder directory.                                                                                |
| `cd my_folder`            | Change directory to `my_folder`.                                                                                               |
| `cd my_folder/sub_folder` | Change directory to `sub_folder` inside `my_folder`. You can hit <kbd>Tab</kbd> to autocomplete the name of the folder.        |
| `cd ..`                   | Move up one directory, aka to the parent directory of the current directory.                                                   |
| `cd ../..`                | Move up two directories, aka to the grandparent directory of the current directory. (How would you move up three directories?) |
| `cd /`                    | Move to the root directory of the file system.                                                                                 |

### Basic file manipulation

You can create, delete, and manipulate files using the terminal. Here are some useful commands for file manipulation.

| Command             | Description                                                                                                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `touch my_file.txt` | Create a new file called `my_file.txt`. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. Mac/Linux only. |
| `mkdir new_folder`  | Create a new directory called `new_folder`.                                                                 |
| `rm my_file.txt`    | Remove a file.                                                                                              |
| `rm -rf dir_name`   | Remove a directory and all its contents. It will not prompt for confirmation.                               |
| `rmdir dir_name`    | Remove a directory. It must be empty in order for this command to work.                                     |
| `cp file1 file2`    | Copy a file (file1 will be copied to file2).                                                                |
| `mv file1 file2`    | Move a file (file1 will be moved to file2). You can also rename a file using this command.                  |

> [!WARNING]
> Be careful when using the `rm` command. It will delete the file without asking for confirmation. It is
> possible to delete your entire computer if you are not careful, as with `rm -rf /*` (NEVER RUN THIS COMMAND). This command is easy to confuse with `rm -rf ./*`, which will delete only the current directory's contents.

### Viewing and editing files

| `ifconfig`                                      | Display your computer's network configuration (Mac/Linux). |

### File permissions (Mac/Linux)

If you're on a Mac or Linux, you can use the terminal to change the permissions of a file. This is important when working with scripts or files, espcially those that other people have written.Here are some useful commands
for file permissions.

| Command                | Description                                                               |
