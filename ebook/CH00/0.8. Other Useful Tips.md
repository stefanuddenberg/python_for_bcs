# 0.8. Other Useful Tips

## Creating Aliases

Aliases are shortcuts that let you run longer commands with shorter names. They're particularly
useful for frequently used commands or complex operations.

### Mac (zsh)

Since macOS Catalina, the default shell is zsh. Here's how to create aliases in zsh:

1. Open your terminal
2. Type `code ~/.zshrc` to open your zsh configuration file (or `nano ~/.zshrc` if you prefer)
3. Add your aliases at the end of the file, one per line. For example:
   ```bash
   alias reload='source ~/.zshrc'
   alias ll='ls -la'
   ```
4. Save and exit. If using `nano`, you can do so by pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>, then
   Enter, then <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>
5. Apply the changes by running `source ~/.zshrc`

Instructions for systems using bash instead of zsh are exactly the same, except you'll use
`~/.bashrc` instead of `~/.zshrc`.

### Windows (PowerShell)

In Windows PowerShell, you can create aliases in two ways:

1. **Temporary Aliases** (lasts only for current session):
   ```powershell
   Set-Alias -Name ll -Value "Get-ChildItem -Force"
   ```

2. **Permanent Aliases** (persists across sessions):
   1. Open PowerShell
   2. Type `notepad $PROFILE` to open your PowerShell profile
   3. If the file doesn't exist, create it by running:
      ```powershell
      New-Item -Path $PROFILE -Type File -Force
      ```
   4. Add your aliases to the file:
      ```powershell
      Set-Alias -Name ll -Value "Get-ChildItem -Force"
      Set-Alias -Name reload -Value "source $PROFILE"
      ```
   5. Save the file and restart PowerShell

Note: The `$PROFILE` location is typically
`C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` (Again, pay
attention to the placeholder present in the command above.)

## Keyboard Shortcuts

One key to getting faster at programming is getting good at using keyboard shortcuts instead of
needing to click around with the mouse a lot. Here are a bunch of examples that you should learn to
do:

- Saving a file (<kbd>CTRL</kbd>/<kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>), copying
  (<kbd>CTRL</kbd>/<kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>), and pasting
  (<kbd>CTRL</kbd>/<kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>) text.

Many text editors also have programming-specific keyboard shortcuts.

- One huge time saver is knowing that you can quickly turn multiple lines of code into comments
  (perhaps code that you want to make so it doesn't run at the moment while you are testing
  something else). You can do this in most text editors by highlighting those multiple lines of code
  and then typing <kbd>CTRL</kbd>/<kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>/</kbd> (i.e., slash, the one on the key with
  the question mark).
- You can duplicate a line by typing <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>⬇︎</kbd>.
- You can move a line up or down by typing <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>⬆︎</kbd> or <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>⬇︎</kbd>.
- Highlight a word and then press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> to highlight the next occurrence of the word. You can keep pressing it to highlight some or all occurrences and then edit all of them simultaneously.

## Telling Your Editor to Use Your Virtual Environment

If you're using VS Code to edit your Python files, you can tell it to use your virtual environment
by opening the project folder in VS Code and then clicking the Python Interpreter dropdown in the
bottom right corner of the window. This will give you a dropdown menu of all the Python interpreters
on your system. You can select the one you want to use (e.g., `.venv/bin/python`) by clicking on it.
Alternatively, you can open the command palette (press
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>) and type "Python: Select Interpreter"
to open the interpreter selection dialog.

This is important because it allows your editor to know which packages are available to you and to
give you proper syntax highlighting and other helpful features (like pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> to
perform autocompletion).

## Commonly misunderstood terms: environment vs. current directory

Up to now, we've used several key terms that are important to understand, but may sound similar to
one another. These are the two that cause the most confusion, the most often.

### Current directory (aka working directory)

Your "current directory", "working directory", or "present working directory" is the folder your
terminal is "in" right now. When you run commands like `uv run python my_script.py`, your terminal
looks for `my_script.py` inside the current directory (unless you give the command a different
path).

You can always see your current directory with `pwd`, and you can change it with `cd`.

### Environment (usually refers to a virtual environment)

Your "environment" is not the same thing as your working directory. Instead, it refers to the
context in which your terminal is running, including which Python installation you're using, what
installed packages you have, and what variables are set and known to your terminal.

In this course, when we say "environment", we typically mean the virtual environment created by `uv
venv`, which creates a folder called `.venv` in your project directory.

Activating it (e.g., `source .venv/bin/activate`) changes what the `python` command points to, and
which packages are available.

Two important points:

- You can be in the *correct current directory* but accidentally use the *wrong environment* (which
  can lead to errors, such as your Python installation not being able to find the packages you need,
  as with a "ModuleNotFoundError").
- VS Code (or any editor) also needs to know both which directory to work in and which environment
  you want, which is why selecting the interpreter (via the command palette or the dropdown in the
  bottom right corner of the VS Code window) matters. You can tell VS Code which directory to work
  in by going to "File" -> "Open Folder" and choosing a given directory, or by using the terminal
  (already positioned in the correct directory) and typing `code .` to open that directory in VS
  Code. (Recall that `.` means "where I am right now in this terminal window".)
