# 18.1. Regular expressions

One of the building blocks of natural language processing is the development of algorithms for **regular expressions**.
The term "regular expression", sometimes also called _regex_ or _regexp_, comes from theoretical computer science, and is
used to define a language family with certain properties.

Regular expressions are a technique to search for strings that match certain conditions. So far in this course we have
already dealt with some very basic regular expressions, like searching for if a certain character was in a word, or if a
word started with a capital letter or ended in punctuation. But that's just the beginning. Regular expressions can be
used to search for a much wider range of things. One nice thing about regular expressions is that the syntax is more or
less the same for all popular programming languages like Python, Perl, Java and the C languages.

## Basic regex in Python

When we first introduced sequential data types in Python, we talked about the "in" operator:

```python
text = "According to reductionist eliminativists, everything about the mind is reducible to brain function."
result = "brain" in text
print(result)
```

Output:

```text
True
```

Regular expressions are just a much more powerful version of this technique. Regular expressions allow us to use
**special sequences** and **metacharacters** to perform advanced searches.

### Searching for patterns in text

To start, Python has a built-in regular expression module called `re`. Once you have imported the `re` module, you can
use it to search for patterns in text using the `search()` method. This method searches for the first occurrence of a
pattern in a string, and returns a "Match" object if it is found. Here's an example:

```python
import re
text = "According to reductionist eliminativists, everything about the mind is reducible to brain function."
pattern = "brain"
match = re.search(pattern, text)
print(match)
pattern = "shoe"
match = re.search(pattern, text)
print(match)

if match:
    print(f"Found {pattern}.")
else:
    print(f"Did not find {pattern}.")
```

Output:

```text
<re.Match object; span=(84, 89), match='brain'>
None
Did not find shoe.
```

The `re.search(pattern, string)` function searches a string for an occurrence of a substring that matches the pattern
being searched for. The first substring (from left) that matches will be returned. We can use the match object in
conditional statements: If a regular expression matches, we get a `match` object returned, which is taken as a `True`
value. If no match is found, we get `None`, which is taken as `False`.

### Match multiple patterns

What if there is more than one occurrence of what you are searching for?

```python
text = "The brain is the most important organ in the body. The brain is responsible for all the body's functions."
pattern = "brain"
matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(matches)
```

Output:

```text
['brain', 'brain']
```

In this example, the `findall()` method is used to find all occurrences of the pattern "brain" in the string "The brain
is the most important organ in the body. The brain is responsible for all the body's functions." It returns a list
containing all the matches.

## Metacharacters

Metacharacters are characters you can insert in a regex statement that allow you to search for all kinds of variable
patterns.

### Search for disjunctive sets using `[]`

You can use `[]` (square brackets) in a regex statement to search for a disjunction of a set of characters inside (i.e.
that it must match at least one of the characters in the square brackets). This is useful if, for example you need to
search for lowercase or capitalized versions of the same thing.

```python
import re
text = "According to reductionist eliminativists, everything about the mind is reducible to Brain function."
pattern = "[Bb]rain"
match = re.search(pattern, text)
```

You could similarly use square brackets to do things like search for any vowel or any number:

```python
pattern = "[aeiou]"
re.search(pattern, text)
pattern = "[01234556789]"
re.search(pattern, text)
```

In cases where a set of characters belongs to a defined sequence, you can use a dash with the square brackets to specify
any one character in a range.

```python
pattern = "[A-Z]"  # any capital letter
re.search(pattern, text)
pattern = "[0-9]"  # any number
re.search(pattern, text)
```

You can use the carat `^` to negate the search, i.e. to see if the character or characters are not in the string. This
only works if carat is the first element in the square brackets. Anywhere else and it actually searches for the carat.
You can use backslash `\` as an escape character to ignore the normal special function of a metacharacter.

```python
pattern = "[^?]"  # not a question mark
pattern = "[^0-9]"  # not a number
pattern = "[12^3]" # will search for and match the string "12^3"
pattern "[\^123]" # will search for and match the string "^123"
```

### Optional characters using `?`

What if we want to search for a pattern but allow it to have optional characters? A common version of this would be
searching for a singular or plural version of a word. We can use a ? character for this. The ? metacharacter returns a
match to the string that comes before it, with or without the character that comes right before it. You will sometimes
see this referred to as matching zero or one occurrence of the previous character.

```python
pattern = "brains?"  # will return a match for "brain" or "brains"
pattern = "colou?r"  # will return a match for "color" or "colour"
```

### Repetitions of characters using `*`

You can use an asterisk `*` to look for repetition of symbols. You will often see this described as matching zero or more
occurrences of the previous character.

```python
pattern = "3*"  # will match any sequence of 3's: 3, 33, 333, 3333333333
```

It can be used in conjunction with square brackets. Metacharacters ignore other metacharacters.

```python
pattern = "[0-9][0-9]*"  # matches any sequence of numbers of any length
pattern = "[xy]*"  # "zero or more x's or y's", i.e., xxxx or xyxyxxyxy or yy.
```

### Match at least one of a character using `+`

You can use the `+` metacharacter to match one or more of a character.

```python
pattern = "a+"  # will match one or more a's
pattern = "[0-9]+"  # one or more numbers
```

### Match any character (except newline) with `.`

A very important metacharacter, often called the "wildcard", is the `.` It can be used to to fill into a any character
where it is inserted.

```python
pattern = "sp.n"  # matches any string wtih s-p-something-n, like spin, span, spun, spkn
pattern = "brain.*brain"  # matches any string where "brain" appears twice
```

### Anchors

Anchors are metacharacters that check for regular expressions to particular places in a string. Examples of anchors are
`ˆ` and `$`. The caret `ˆ` matches a string at the start of a line.

```python
pattern = "^Brains"  # matches the word "Brains" at the beginning of the string (case-sensitive)
```

Note that this makes `^` (caret) have three uses: 1) a match at the start of a line, 2) negation inside of square
brackets, and 3) just to mean a caret.

### Summary of metacharacters

Above we have covered some but not all the metacharacters. Below is a table summary of the metacharacters we have
discussed, as well as a few more:

| Metacharacter | Description                                                   | Example                                                                                        |

## Special sequences

In addition to the standard metacharacters, there are also special sequences that can look for even more kinds of
matches.

| Character | Description                                                                              | Example                                                                                            |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \A        | Matches the start of a string (like `^`, but `\A` is string-specific, not line-specific) | `"\ABrain"` will match "Brain" at the start of the string.                                         |
| \b        | Matches a word boundary (the position between a word character and a non-word character) | `r"\bBrain"` matches "Brain" at the beginning of a word, `"Brain\b"` matches at the end of a word. |
| \B        | Matches where `\b` does not, i.e., not at a word boundary                                | `r"\Bain"` matches "ain" in "Brains" but not at the start or end of a word.                        |
| \d        | Matches any digit (equivalent to `[0-9]`)                                                | `"\d"` matches "3" in "Brain3".                                                                    |
| \D        | Matches any non-digit (equivalent to `[^0-9]`)                                           | `"\D"` matches "B" in "Brain3".                                                                    |
| \s        | Matches any whitespace character (e.g., space, tab, newline)                             | `"\s"` matches the space in "Brain Power".                                                         |
| \S        | Matches any non-whitespace character                                                     | `"\S"` matches "B" in " Brain".                                                                    |
| \w        | Matches any word character (alphanumeric + underscore, `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`)                   | `"\w"` matches "B" in "Brain".                                                                     |
| \W        | Matches any non-word character (anything not in `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`)                          | `"\W"` matches the space in "Brain Power".                                                         |
| \Z        | Matches the end of a string (like `$`, but `\Z` is string-specific, not line-specific)   | `"Brain\Z"` matches "Brain" only at the end of a string.                                           |

## Complex examples

Regular expressions are incredibly powerful, and also incredibly complicated. You can do crazy stuff. Consider this
example. Consider the following imaginary list of phone numbers. Not all entries contain a phone number, but if a phone
number exists it is the first part of an entry. Then, separated by a blank, a surname follows, which is followed by
first names. Surname and first name are separated by a comma. The task is to rewrite this example in the following way:

```python
import re
text_list = ["847-8096 Bieber, Justin",
             "124-7852 West, Kanye",
             "Swift, Taylor",
             "175-1485 Knowles, Beyonce Giselle "]

for i in text_list:
    res = re.search(r"([0-9-]*)\s*([A-Za-z]+),\s+(.*)", i)
    print(res.group(3) + " " + res.group(2) + " " + res.group(1))
```

output:

```text
Justin Bieber 847-8096
Kanye West 124-7852
Taylor Swift
Beyonce Giselle Knowles 175-1485
```

So if you have text in a particular format, you can use very complex regular expressions to match part of it, and then
reformat it in various ways.

You can use it to do all kinds of validation of data, for example emails, passwords, urls, and social media data:

```python
def validate_email(email):
    regex = r"^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$"
    return bool(re.match(regex, email))
```

This regular expression:

- checks that the email address contains one or more alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, percent signs, plus
  signs, or hyphens before the "@"
- that the domain name consists of one or more alphanumeric characters, dots, or hyphens, followed by a period and two
  or more alphabetical characters.

If the email address matches this pattern, the function returns `True`, indicating that the email address is valid.
Otherwise, the function returns `False`.

Here are some other examples:

```python
def extract_urls(text):
    regex = r"(http|https):\/\/[a-zA-Z0-9-\.]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}(\S*)"
    return re.findall(regex, text)

def validate_password(password):
    regex = r"^(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[!@#$%^&*()_+}{\":;\'?\/><.,])(?!.*\s).{8,}$"
    return bool(re.match(regex, password))

def preprocess_tweet(tweet):
    tweet = re.sub(r"http\S+", "", tweet) # Remove URLs
    tweet = re.sub(r"@\S+", "", tweet) # Remove mentions
    tweet = re.sub(r"#\S+", "", tweet) # Remove hashtags
    tweet = re.sub(r"[^\w\s]", "", tweet) # Remove punctuation marks
    return tweet
```
