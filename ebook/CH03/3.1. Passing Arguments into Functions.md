# 3.1 Passing arguments into functions

As we noted, it is common to pass data into a function. You will sometimes hear these called parameters and sometimes
hear them called arguments. The terms technically mean slightly different things. We call the variable that is defined
in the function a parameter, and we call it an argument when we are talking about the actual values that are assigned to
those variables when the function is called. Consider, for example, the following function for computing and printing
out some properties of a circle:

```python
def print_circle_info(x, y, radius):
    center = (x, y)
    pi = 3.1415

    circumference = 2 * pi * radius

    area = pi * radius**2

    top_tangent_point = (x, y - radius)
    bottom_tangent_point = (x, y + radius)

    print(f"Your circle has an area of {area:0.3f} and a circumference of {circumference:0.3f}")
    print(f"The center of the circle is {center}")
    print(f"It's top and bottom tangent points are {top_tangent_point} and {bottom_tangent_point}")


center = (5, 3)
the_radius = 4
print_circle_info(center[0], center[1], the_radius)
```

The `print_circle_info` function has three parameters: the x and y coordinates at the middle of the circle and its
radius. The values 5, 3, and 4 are what we would consider the current arguments of `print_circle_info` when it is called
on the last line of the code above.

Because the function has three parameters, every time the function is called, it must be supplied with three arguments.
This is the default behavior for Python functions; the number of parameters and the number of arguments must match. The
arguments that are passed into the function are assigned to the parameters in the order that they are specified. If one
should accidentally screw up the order of the arguments by doing the following:

```python
print_circle_info(the_radius, center[0], center[1])
```

Then, in the current code, Python would have no way of knowing that `the_radius` was supposed to be assigned to the
third parameter. It isn't smart like that, and it can't match the names. It just matches them up by order. So, in this
case, the value in `the_radius` (4) would get assigned to `x`, the value in `x` (5) would get assigned to `y`, and the
value in `y` (3) would get assigned to the `radius`.

As a general rule, the number of arguments (values passed in) and parameters (variables defined in the function
definition) must match. But there is one important exception which we will discuss next.

## Default arguments for parameters

You can define a function to have a default value for a parameter in the event that it is not specified:

```python
def print_location(location="Champaign"):

    print(f"You live in {location}!")

print_location()

city = "Urbana"
print_location(city)
```

In the example above, when the parameter location is defined inside the function, the parameter is also assigned a
value. This value will be automatically assigned to the variable if that argument is not passed into the function. So in
this example, we have a function with a single optional parameter, and so it can be called with either one or zero
arguments provided.

It may occur to you that if you can have parameters with default arguments, then that creates a confusing situation when
you mix parameters with and without defaults. Parameters without defaults match the arguments to the parameters in the
order they are supplied, and so optional arguments would screw this up because it would make the order or the arguments
unpredictable. For this reason, Python requires that all parameters without arguments be defined first, and optional
arguments come after that. See the example below.

```python
def print_personal_info(first_name, last_name, species="Human", favorite_food=None):
    print(f"Hello {first_name} {last_name}.")

    # check to see if the species name starts with a vowel, so we use the correct article before it
    if species[0] in ['A', 'E', "I", "O", "U", "a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]:
        article = "an"
    else:
        article = "a"

    print(f"I see that you are {article} {species}.")

    if favorite_food:
        print(f"I also see that your favorite food is {favorite_food}.")
    else:
        print("I do not know what your favorite food is.")

print_personal_info("Edward", "Cullen", "vampire", "blood")
print_personal_info("Jon", "Willits", favorite_food="pizza")
print_personal_info("Nerwen", "Galadrial", favorite_food="lembas bread", species="elf")
```

![Output from example function `print_personal_info()`](../images/function_output1.png)

In this example, we have a function that prints some information about a person. The function has two required
parameters (first_name and last_name) and two optional parameters (species and favorite_food). In the function
definition, the optional parameters must come at the end of the sequence of defined parameters.

Notice that when the functions are called, there are options about how to provide arguments.

- In general, the required arguments must come first
- If the optional arguments are provided in the order they are defined (like in the first example), you don't need to
  specify the parameter names; they work just like normal parameters
- If you want to provide an optional argument that is not the next one in the definition order, then you must specify
  the parameter's name (as in the second example)
- You can specify any of the optional arguments in any order as long as you use the parameter name when you call the
  function (as in the third example)
- However, if you must specify your arguments out of order, then you must specify every parameter name, as below:

```python
print_personal_info(species="vampire", last_name="Cullen", favorite_food="blood", first_name="Edward")
```

There is another useful detail worth pointing out in this example. If you define a function with optional parameters,
you can assign any kind of variable as the default. In the case of the species above, we supplied a string. But in the
case of favorite_food, we provide the value `None`. Remember that `None` is a special kind of variable type all of its
own. It is common in defining functions with optional variables to declare its default value as `None`, because that
allows us to perform a simple boolean check to see if the variable has a value, as we do in this function. When we use
the command `if favorite_food:`, if `favorite_food` is `None`, the `if` statement evaluates as `False`. That allows us
to set up a nice bit of code that will run as a default if one of our variables doesn't have a value.

## Positional-only and keyword-only arguments

What if you wanted to force the user to pass arguments by position or by keyword? Luckily, Python 3 introduced special
syntax for defining positional-only and keyword-only arguments in functions. These features allow you to control exactly
how arguments must be passed to your functions.

### Positional-only arguments

Positional-only parameters are defined before a `/` in the parameter list and must be specified by position, not keyword:

```python
def divide(x, y, /, result_type="float"):
    # Perform floating-point division if `result_type == "float"`,
    # otherwise perform integer division
    # note: `x` and `y` must be passed positionally
    # note: `result_type` can be passed by either position or keyword
    # note: `result_type` defaults to "float"
    return x / y if result_type == "float" else x // y

divide(10, 3)  # Valid
divide(x=10, y=3)  # Oops! `x` and `y` are positional-only; they can't be passed by keyword!
```

### Keyword-only arguments

Keyword-only parameters are defined after a `*` or `*args` and must be specified using keywords:

```python
def greet(*, name, greeting="Hello"):
    # `name` and `greeting` must be passed by keyword
    # In this case, `name` has no default value, while `greeting` does.
    print(f"{greeting}, {name}!")

greet(name="Alice")  # Valid
greet(greeting="Hi", name="Alice")  # Valid! Keyword arguments ignore order
greet("Alice")  # Oops! `name` was passed positionally; it must be passed by keyword!
```

These features help make function interfaces more explicit and prevent confusion about how arguments should be passed. While you may not need to use these features often in your own code, you may encounter them out in the wild â€” it's good to know they exist.
