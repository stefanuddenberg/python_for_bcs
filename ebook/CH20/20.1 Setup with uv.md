# 20.1. Setup with `uv`

In Chapter 0, you learned how to install Python packages and manage virtual environments using
[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). In this section, we are going to use `uv` to set up a small web
project that uses FastAPI and SQLModel.

> [!TIP]
>
> If you already have a `bcog200` project with a `.venv` folder and a `pyproject.toml`, you can do
> all of this _in that same project_. If you want to keep this chapter separate, start by making a
> new folder with a name you can understand, like `bcog200_web`.

## Step 1: Make (or enter) a project folder

Pick a folder you want to work in. For example, we can navigate to our `bcog200` folder on the
Desktop and create a new folder called `bcog200_web` in there:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/bcog200
mkdir bcog200_web
cd bcog200_web
```

If you have not initialized this folder as a `uv` project yet, you can do so with:

```bash
uv init
```

## Step 2: Create and activate a virtual environment

Create a virtual environment for this project (we will use Python 3.13, like earlier chapters):

```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.13
```

Activate it:

```bash
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate

# On Mac/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Step 3: Install the web packages

Install FastAPI, SQLModel, Jinja2, Python-Multipart, and the server we will use to run FastAPI (`uvicorn`), all with a single command:

```bash
uv add fastapi sqlmodel jinja2 python-multipart "uvicorn[standard]"
```

Jinja2 is a templating library for Python, and Python-Multipart is a library for parsing HTML form submissions. We will use those later on in the chapter.

This installs all those packages and updates your `pyproject.toml` automatically, so your dependencies are tracked correctly.

## Step 4: Verify your setup

Let's quickly check that your environment is active and the packages can be imported by running a small Python script (you should be able to just copy/paste this into your terminal at this point):

```bash
python -c "import fastapi, sqlmodel; print('FastAPI:', fastapi.__version__); print('SQLModel:', sqlmodel.__version__)"
```

You should see version numbers printed like below (and encounter no errors):

```text
FastAPI: 0.115.6
SQLModel: 0.0.20
```

Now you should be good to go!

> [!NOTE]
>
> ### Running Python code inline
>
> We just ran a little Python script inline. The `-c` flag tells Python to execute the code passed
> to it as a string. Semicolons are used here to separate valid statements, rather
> than using new lines.
