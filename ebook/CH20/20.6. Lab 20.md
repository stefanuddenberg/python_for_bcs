# 20.6. Lab 20

For this lab, your goal is to get our tiny online survey from Chapter 20 working from start to
finish. This is especially important as you will build on this for Homework 20! Follow the steps
from Chapter 20 and make sure your survey is working. This means that all of the following
conditions should be met:

1. You can run your server with `uvicorn main:app --reload` and it will start up
2. Visiting `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` shows your TIPI demo form
3. Submitting the form shows your "Thank you" page along with the details of the submitted data
4. Submitting the form creates (or updates) a `survey.db` file in your project folder
5. Visiting `http://127.0.0.1:8000/responses` shows a list of saved responses as JSON

Once your survey is working, submit **at least 3** distinct responses. Zip up the project folder,
including the `survey.db` file and name it `lab20.zip`. You will submit this zip file as your lab
assignment.
