# 15.0. Data visualization

`matplotlib` is a Python library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations. Here we are going to use
going to use our `mcdi` dataset to create commonly used plot types including bar, histogram, line and scatter plots. To
begin make sure to import the `matplotlib` module as follows.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

Typing `matplotlib.pyplot` every time is annoying, so it is pretty standard to see people create the `plt` alias.
