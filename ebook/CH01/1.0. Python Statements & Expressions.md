# 1.0 Python Statements and Expressions

Python is a language that consists of **statements** and **expressions**.

A **statement** is how we refer to any line of code that Python can execute. Here are some examples.

```python
x = 5
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 10")
```

An **expression** is a piece of code that evaluates to a value. Below I've included some examples of
expressions and statements, with their descriptions written in comments next to them.

```python
2 + 3 # Expression, evaluates to 5
a = [1, 2, 3] # Assignment statement, not an expression
[i*2 for i in a] # List comprehension, an expression that evaluates to [2, 4, 6]
b = [i*2 for i in a] # Assignment statement that assigns to the value of that expression
x = 5 # Assignment statement, not an expression
y = 'dog' # Assignment statement, not an expression
z = x * y # Assignment statement that assigns to the value of the expression: x * y
len(a) # Function call expression (this one evaluates to 3)
```

Expressions can be used as part of statements (like on the right-hand side of an assignment). Some
expressions are also valid by themselves as _expression statements_, often because they do something
useful as a side-effect (like calling a function). But some statements—like `if`, `import`, and
assignments are not expressions.

## Exercise: Statements and Expressions

### Part A (expressions)

What will each of the following **expressions** evaluate to?

```python
3 + 3
5 * 2
10 / 2
5 ** 2
```

### Part B (statements)

Now consider these **statements**. After running them, what are the final values of `x`, `y`, and `z`?

```python
x = 10 % 3
y = x * 4
z = y * x
```

```python
3 + 3  # 6
5 * 2  # 10
10 / 2  # 5
5 ** 2  # 25

x = 10 % 3  # 1
y = x * 4  # 4
z = y * x  # 4
```
