# 1.0 Python Statements and Expressions

Python is a language that consists of **statements** and **expressions**.

A **statement** is how we refer to any line of code that Python can execute. Here are some examples.

```Python
print(x)
if x > 10:
x = 5
```

An **expression** is a specific kind of statement that expresses or evaluates to some value.

```Python
2 + 3 # Expression, evaluates to 5
a = [1, 2, 3] # Assignment statement, not an expression
[i*2 for i in a] # List comprehension, an expression that evaluates to [2, 4, 6]
b = [i*2 for i in a] # Assignment statement that assigns to the value of that expression
x = 5 # Assignment statement, not an expression
y = 'dog' # Assignment statement, not an expression
z = x * y # Assignment statement that assigns to the value of the expression: x * y
```

An expression is a kind of statement, but not all statements are expressions. The _print()_ command and the _if_
command, for example, don't express values, so they are statements (they _do_ something), but not expressions (they
don't _express_ anything â€” they don't _evaluate_ to anything). Expressions can be used as a part of statements, but
statements can't be used as a part of expressions.
