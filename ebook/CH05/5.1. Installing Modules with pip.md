# 5.1 Installing Modules with pip

"Pip" is the name of the program that you run in the terminal to install extra Python modules. "Pip3" (the version of
`pip` for installing packages with Python 3) comes installed with Python 3 on many machines.

## Making Sure pip3 is installed

To see if you have `pip3` installed on your machine, go to your terminal and type:

```bash
pip3 --version
```

If it is installed you should see something like this:

![pip3 output](../images/pip3.png)

Note that at the end of the output, it says what version of Python `pip3` is configured for. Make sure it is Python 3.12
(or whatever version of Python you are using).

If `pip3` is not installed, you will see a message saying that the command `pip3` is not recognized.

If you have Windows, this almost certainly worked. But sometimes on Unix and Mac, `pip3` may not install automatically. If
that happened to you, go to the terminal and type:

```bash
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
```

After it has finished downloading, then type the following in your terminal:

```bash
python3.12 get-pip.py
```

It should now output as shown above, and be configured to work with Python 3.12.

## Installing Modules with Pip3

Now that `pip3` is installed, adding modules is easy. Let's start with numpy. At the terminal, type:

```bash
pip3 install numpy
```

You should see it download and install. You can verify that it worked by opening up the interactive Python terminal and
typing `import numpy`. If you get an error saying `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named numpy` then there was a problem.
Otherwise, you're good to go!
