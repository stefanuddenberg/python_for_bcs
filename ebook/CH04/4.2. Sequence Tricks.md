# 4.2 Sequence tricks

Now that we have covered all of our basic data types in Python, let's talk about a few more tricks.

## Sorting data structures

We've already sorted lists. You can use the same trick to sort sets and dictionaries.

Now remember that sets are not ordered, so sorting it converts it into a list.

```python
my_animals = {'dog', 'lion', 'mouse', 'cat'}
sorted_animals = sorted(my_animals)
print(sorted_animals)
# results in ['cat', 'dog', 'lion', 'mouse']
```

It sorts alphabetically, you can sort in reverse by adding a reverse argument.

```python
my_animals = {'dog', 'lion', 'mouse', 'cat'}
sorted_animals = sorted(my_animals, reverse=True)
print(sorted_animals)
# results in ['mouse', 'lion', 'dog', 'cat']
```

You can sort dictionaries too, but it is a little more complicated since it is a key-value pair. But remember that we
can use the `.keys()`, `.values()`, and `.items()` methods to get lists of the keys, values, or key-value pairs. We can
then sort them the same way we do lists.

```python
animal_populations = {'dog': 471000000, 'cat': 600000000, 'bee': 2000000000000, 'human': 8000000000}
animals = sorted(animal_populations.keys())
populations = sorted(animal_populations.values())
populations = sorted(animal_populations.items())
```

Remember that `.items()` creates tuples with the key and then the value, so this will sort the tuples by the key. But if
we wanted them sorted by the value we can do that too:

```python
animal_populations = {'dog': 471000000, 'cat': 600000000, 'bee': 2000000000000, 'human': 8000000000}
sorted(animal_populations.items(), key=lambda item: item[1])
```

It's quite common to sort using lambda functions rather than fully fledged functions. (For a review
of lambda functions, see the eponymous section in [Chapter 3.0](../CH03/3.0.%20Functions.md).)
Basically, we can use this lambda expression to say what we want to sort the tuples by. Using
`item[1]` sorts by the second slot, the values from the dictionary. Using `item[0]` would have
sorted by the keys. And of course, it doesn't matter what we call the parameter in the lambda
function, so long as we're consistent. We could have used `x` instead of `item` and it would have
worked equally well.
