# 4.4. Lab 4

```python
"""
This lab will be the first time that we directly organize the questions into separate functions,
then call them from the main function. This is to practice the general structure of a
well-organized program. When appropriate, this structure will be followed for the
labs from here on out. Follow the instructions within each function to complete the lab.
