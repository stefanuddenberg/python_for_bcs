# 4.0 Sets

This week we're introducing two new data structures: sets and dictionaries. Let's start with sets,
as they are the simpler of the two.

A set in Python is just like what you have learned about in math class way back in the day: a
collection of unique items. So a set is really a lot like a list, except that it cannot have
duplicates, and it isn't ordered (meaning you can't access items by index, like `my_animals[2]`).
Sets can be of any data type: int, float, string, boolean, even lists and other sets.

## Creating sets

To declare an empty set and then add items to it in Python:

```python
my_animals = set()

my_animals.add("dog")
my_animals.add("cat")
my_animals.add("lion")
my_animals.add("giraffe")
my_animals.add("giraffe")  # giraffe was added twice, but because its a set this will be ignored.
```

If you print a set, it prints out inside curly brackets:

```python
my_animals = {"dog", "cat", "lion", "giraffe"}
print(my_animals)
'''
the above command will generate:
{'dog', 'lion', 'giraffe', 'cat'}
'''
```

You can also create with items in it like you can with a list; just use curly brackets instead of square brackets:

```python
my_animals = {"dog", "cat", "lion", "giraffe"}
print(my_animals)
'''
the above command will generate:
{'dog', 'lion', 'giraffe', 'cat'}
'''
```

Notice that when we print a set, its members are not in the order they were inserted, nor are they
in alphabetical order. This is because sets are *unordered*, and the order you see is an
implementation detail that depends on "hashing" (which helps Python check for membership quickly).

Alas, you can't sort a set in-place, but there is a workaround: you can make a sorted **list** of
the set's elements using the `sorted()` function:

```python
my_animals = {"dog", "cat", "lion", "giraffe"}
sorted_animals = sorted(my_animals)
print(sorted_animals)  # ['cat', 'dog', 'giraffe', 'lion']
```

This trick will come up again in [4.2. Sequence Tricks](4.2.%20Sequence%20Tricks.md).

Just as we can convert sets to lists, the opposite is also true: you can convert other data
structures, like tuples and lists, into sets, thereby removing the duplicates. You do this by
passing the list into the `set()` definition.

```python
animal_list = ["lion", "lion", "tiger", "dog", "cat"]
animal_set = set(animal_list)
```

Notice that the set definition looks like a function: it has parentheses and can be passed an
argument. It is a function! If you don't provide it with an argument, it creates an empty set by
default (so `set()` is equivalent to `set([])`). Otherwise, it creates a set out of whatever you
give it as input.

## Accessing set members

Because sets are not officially ordered, you CANNOT access items in a set like a list, with a
number:

```python
my_animals = {"dog", "cat", "lion", "giraffe"}

# Let's try to access the third item in the set
my_animals[2]  # Oops! This would generate an error!
# Sets are UNORDERED, so there is no zeroth item, much less a third item!
```

Instead, the main way to access elements of a set is to set up a for loop with the set as the
iterator. You can also use the `if` statement to see if an item is in a set.

```python
my_animals = {"dog", "cat", "lion", "giraffe"}
for item in my_animals:
    print(item)

the_animal = "lion"
if the_animal in my_animals:
    print(the_animal)
```

## Set methods

Sets have a bunch of methods (in addition to `.add()`), just like lists.

```python
my_animals = set(['dog', 'cat', 'lion', 'giraffe'])
your_animals = {'dog', 'mouse', 'giraffe', 'elephant'}

my_animals.add({'bear', 'dolphin'})  # Adds an element to the set. Note you can add other sets
my_animals.discard('lion')	# Removes the specified item; does nothing if not in set
my_animals.remove('lion')	#  Removes the specified element; or gives error if not in set
my_animals.clear()  # Removes all elements from set

# Resetting my_animals
my_animals = set(['dog', 'cat', 'lion', 'giraffe'])
the_copy = my_animals.copy()  # Gives you a copy of the set

the_diff = my_animals.difference(your_animals)  # Returns a set containing the difference between two or more sets
# result would be the set {'cat', 'lion'}, the stuff in the set the method was used for that aren't in the one passed in
the_diff = your_animals.difference(my_animals)
# result would be {'mouse', 'elephant'}

our_animals = my_animals.union(your_animals)	# Returns a set containing the union of the two sets
the_intersection = my_animals.intersection(your_animals)  # Returns a set that is the intersection of the two sets
# the result would be the set {'dog', 'lion'}, assuming lion hadn't been removed or my_animals cleared
my_animals.symmetric_difference(your_animals)	# Returns a set with all items not in both sets
# the result would be the set {'cat', 'lion', 'mouse', 'elephant'

is_disjoint = my_animals.isdisjoint(your_animals)	# Returns T/F, whether two sets have an intersection or not
my_animals.issubset(your_animals)	# Returns T/F, whether another set contains this set or not
my_animals.issuperset(your_animals)	#  Returns whether this set contains another set or not
```

Many of these methods can also be run across multiple sets at once. Here are a few examples:

```python
# let's make three sets. First, we'll use the set keyword to make a set from a list
my_animals = set(["dog", "cat", "lion", "giraffe"])
your_animals = {"dog", "mouse", "giraffe", "elephant"} # using curly brackets to make a set
their_animals = {"dog", "lion", "tiger", "elephant"}

my_sets = [my_animals, your_animals, their_animals]

# we can use set.union to get all the possible animals from all three sets
# we can do this by passing all the sets as arguments
all_animals = set.union(my_animals, your_animals, their_animals)
# returns the set {'dog', 'cat', 'lion', 'giraffe', 'mouse', 'elephant', 'tiger'}
# though the order you see may differ, since sets are unordered collections

# we can get all the animals held in common with set.intersection
# here we are unpacking the sets with the * operator
common_animals = set.intersection(*my_sets)
# returns {'dog'} since only dog is in all three sets
```
