# 4.1 Dictionaries

Now let's learn one of the most important and useful data structures in python: dictionaries.

So far all of our data structures have been simple sequences:

- `range`: a set of numbers
- `list`: a mutable (i.e., changeable) ordered sequence
- `tuple`: an immutable (i.e., unchangeable) ordered sequence
- `set`: a mutable unordered sequence without duplicates (you can actually create an immutable set using `frozenset()`
  instead of `set()`, and you can use all the same methods except those that change the set)

Dictionaries are different, in that each element of a dictionary is a pair of things, a key, and a value. Dicionaries
are like a set of unique keys, where each key points to a value. Think of an actual dictionary. It has a set of words,
and each one points to a definition. We can create an actual dictionary with a python dictionary:

```python
word_meaning_dict = {
    "run": "to move with haste; act quickly",
    "jump": "to spring clear of the ground or other support by a sudden muscular effort",
    "talk": "to consult or confer"
}
```

To create a dictionary in python, we use curly brackets just like a set, except that instead of adding single items, we
add key-value pairs. Dictionaries can be defined as we did above, with data already in them, or they can be defined
empty (with just the curly brackets with nothing inside them). In either case, we can add items to a dictionary after
defining it like this:

```python
word_meaning_dict = {}
word_meaning_dict["eat"] = "to take into the mouth and swallow for nourishment; chew and swallow (food)."
```

We can then access dictionary items by using the key in the same way we just added one:

```python
print(word_meaning_dict["jump"])
# output would be: "to spring clear of the ground or other support by a sudden muscular effort"
```

Sometimes it is useful to think of a dictionary like a list, with an important difference. In a list, the organization
is the order of a list, so we access each member using a number. In a dictionary, the organization is the key. We access
data the same way as with a list (using square brackets), but we provide the key instead of a number.

Dictionaries are mutable, meaning you can change them. The keys of a dictionary must be unique, but the values do not
need to be. You could, for example, have a dictionary of people's names and their birthdays. Every name in the
dictionary would need to be unique, but multiple people could have the same birthday.

## Data structures you can use in dictionaries

The values of dictionaries can be any kind of data type: strings, numbers, booleans, lists, tuples, sets, even other
dictionaries. As we will talk about in later sections, data structures can get pretty complicated: dictionaries of
dictionaries, lists of dictionaries, dictionaries of lists of sets. Oh my!

The keys of dictionaries can be any immutable data type: string, int, float, tuple, boolean, frozenset. One way to think
about and make sense of this is that you cannot change a key in a dictionary once you've created it. You can replace it,
but not change it. In the example below, I can change the value of 'Jon', but I cannot change the key. If I wanted to do
that I would need to delete the entry and create a new entry.

```python
birthday_dict = {'Jon': '11-04', 'Andrew': '10-21', 'Jonathan': '12-03', 'Lin Khern': '10-04'}
birthday_dict['Jon'] = '11-11'

# imagine the name was misspelled
del birthday_dict['Jon'] # deletes the key and value
birthday_dict['John'] = '11-04'
```

This is the reason you cannot use a mutable data type (like a list or a set) as the key of a dictionary. If you made the
key a list of words, and then added a word to the list, then the key would change, and that's not allowed. But you can
use a tuple of words as a key, and if you want to be able to change the keys, then you just have to use the delete and
replace method described above.

## Accessing dictionary data

In addition to accessing data by using they key inside square brackets, there are other ways you can get at dictionary
data.

### Get a list of a dictionaries keys, or values, or both:

```python
word_meaning_dict = {
    "run": "to move with haste",
    "jump": "to spring clear of the ground or other support by a sudden muscular effort",
    "talk": "to consult or confer",
}
word_list = word_meaning_dict.keys()
# ["run", "jump", "talk"]

meaning_list = word_meaning_dict.values()
# ["to move with haste", "to spring clear of the ground", "to consult or confer"]

word_meaning_list = word_meaning_dict.items()
# .items() gives you a list of tuples
# [("run", "to move with haste"), ("jump", "to spring clear of the ground"), ("talk", "to consult or confer")]
```

<br>

### Use the len() function to see how many entries are in a dictionary:

```python
word_meaning_dict = {
    "run": "to move with haste",
    "jump": "to spring clear of the ground or other support by a sudden muscular effort",
    "talk": "to consult or confer",
}
print(len(word_meaning_dict))  # output is 3
```

<br>

### Looping over dictionaries

Dictionaries are a sequence (of keys), so you can also loop over dictionaries just like a list.

```python
word_meaning_dict = {
    "run": "to move with haste; act quickly",
    "jump": "to spring clear of the ground or other support by a sudden muscular effort",
    "talk": "to consult or confer",
}

for word in word_meaning_dict:
    print(f"{word}: {word_meaning_dict[word]}")
```

<br>

### Checking to see if a key is in a dictionary

You can combine the previous methods to iterate over keys and values at the same time:

```python
word_meaning_dict = {
    "run": "to move with haste; act quickly",
    "jump": "to spring clear of the ground or other support by a sudden muscular effort",
    "talk": "to consult or confer",
}

for word, definition in word_meaning_dict.items():
    print(f"{word}: {definition}")
```

Remember that `.items()` gives you back a list of tuples, so what's really happening here is that you're creating that
list of tuples, and then unpacking the values of that tuple one at a time into the two variables provided in the for
loop.

Finally, as with lists and sets, you can check to see if a key is in a dictionary:

```python
word_meaning_dict = {
    "run": "to move with haste; act quickly",
    "jump": "to spring clear of the ground or other support by a sudden muscular effort",
    "talk": "to consult or confer",
}

word = "run"
if word in word_meaning_dict:
    print(f"Found the word {word}. It's meaning is: {word_meaning_dict[word]}")
```

When you aren't sure if a key is in a dictionary, you can use `.get()` to safely access the value
stored at that key (if it exists) and return a default value if it doesn't exist.

```python
word_meaning_dict = {
    "run": "to move with haste; act quickly",
    "jump": "to spring clear of the ground or other support by a sudden muscular effort",
    "talk": "to consult or confer",
}

print(word_meaning_dict.get("run", "Unknown word")) # "to move with haste; act quickly"
print(word_meaning_dict.get("walk", "Unknown word")) # "Unknown word"

```

Conversely, if you want your dictionary to have default values baked into it, you can use
`defaultdict` from the `collections` module.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

word_meaning_dict = defaultdict(lambda: "Unknown word")
word_meaning_dict["run"] = "to move with haste; act quickly"

print(word_meaning_dict["run"]) # "to move with haste; act quickly"
print(word_meaning_dict["walk"]) # "Unknown word"
```

This is especially useful when counting things:

```python
word_counts = defaultdict(int) # This creates a dictionary with default value 0
# this is because `int()` returns 0: the default value for an int

# Let's suppose we have a list of words and we want to count the occurrences of each word
words = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "cherry", "banana", "apple"]
for word in words:
    word_counts[word] += 1

print(word_counts) # {"apple": 3, "banana": 2, "cherry": 1}
```

> [!TIP]  
> You can also count the occurrences of each word in a list using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module.
> ```python
> from collections import Counter 
> 
> words = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "cherry", "banana", "apple"]
> word_counts = Counter(words)
> print(word_counts) # Counter({'apple': 3, 'banana': 2, 'cherry': 1})
> ``` 

### Nested dictionaries

Of course, dictionaries are not limited to what is allowed as a value. This means you can even have
dictionaries inside of other dictionaries ad infinitum!

```python
# a nested dictionary of cities and their information
cities = {
    "Chicago": {
        "state": "IL",
        "population": 2_709_364,
        "coordinates": {"lat": 41.881832, "lon": -87.623177},
        "sports": {"MLB": ["Cubs", "White Sox"], "NBA": ["Bulls"]},
    },
    "St. Louis": {
        "state": "MO",
        "population": 279_695,
        "coordinates": {"lat": 38.6270, "lon": -90.1994},
        "sports": {"MLB": ["Cardinals"]},
    },
}
```

We can then access information from each level of the dictionary using square brackets.

```python
# see the whole dictionary
print(cities)

# get all the information about Chicago
print(cities["Chicago"])

# get the population of Chicago
print(cities["Chicago"]["population"])

# get the latitude and longitude of Chicago
print(cities["Chicago"]["coordinates"]["lat"])
print(cities["Chicago"]["coordinates"]["lon"])

# get the MLB teams in Chicago
print(cities["Chicago"]["sports"]["MLB"])

# get the MLB teams in St. Louis
print(cities["St. Louis"]["sports"]["MLB"])

# increment the population of Chicago by 50_000
cities["Chicago"]["population"] += 50_000
print(cities["Chicago"]["population"])
```
