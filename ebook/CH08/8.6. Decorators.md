# 8.6 Decorators

So far, we've encountered functions that return variables (such as integers, strings, lists, and so on) or nothing at
all. However, because functions are "first-class citizens" in Python, they can do much more — they can be passed as
arguments to other functions, stored in variables, and even returned from other functions. This means a function can
create and return _another function_, just like it can create and return a number or a string.

Think of it this way: if a function can create a number (like `def give_me_a_five(): return 5`), it can also create a
function (like `def make_greeting(): return lambda: "Hello"`). This ability to treat functions like any other value is
what makes _decorators_ possible.

Decorators are a way to modify or enhance functions without directly changing their source code. You can think of them
as "wrappers" that add extra functionality around your existing functions. They use a special `@` symbol syntax that
makes them easy to apply and read.

Some common uses for decorators include, but are not limited to:

- Adding logging before and after a function runs (you would have seen an example of this in 8.3 with `pysnooper`)
- Measuring how long a function takes to execute (as with a timer)
- Checking if a user has permission to run a function (as with an access control decorator)
- Saving (or _caching_) function results to make accessing those results faster next time

## Basic decorator syntax

Let's see how a decorator works by looking at a simple example:

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```

When you run this code, the output will be:

```text
Something is happening before the function is called.
Hello!
Something is happening after the function is called.
```

The `@my_decorator` syntax is equivalent to writing:

```python
say_hello = my_decorator(say_hello)
```

## Preserving function metadata with functools.wraps

When you create a decorator, you're actually _replacing_ the original function with the wrapper function. This can cause
some issues (especially when debugging) because the new, replaced wrapper function doesn't carry the original function's
metadata (e.g. name, docstring). Let's take a closer look at the problem:

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        """I am the wrapper function"""
        print("Something is happening before...")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("Something is happening after...")
        return result
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def greet(name):
    """This function greets someone by name"""
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

print(greet.__name__)  # Prints: 'wrapper' instead of 'greet'
print(greet.__doc__)   # Prints: 'I am the wrapper function' instead of 'This function greets someone by name'
```

To fix this, the Python standard library provides `functools.wraps`, which preserves the original function's metadata:

```python
from functools import wraps

def my_decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)  # This preserves func's metadata
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Something is happening before...")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("Something is happening after...")
        return result
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def greet(name):
    """This function greets someone by name"""
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

print(greet.__name__)  # Prints: 'greet'
print(greet.__doc__)   # Prints: 'This function greets someone by name'
```

Using `@wraps` is considered a best practice when writing decorators, as it helps with debugging and makes the decorated function behave more like you'd expect.

## Decorators with arguments

Decorators can also accept arguments from the functions they wrap:

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"About to call {func.__name__}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs) # call the decorated function and save the result
        print(f"Finished calling {func.__name__}")
        return result
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")
```

Notice the use of `*args` and `**kwargs` in the wrapper function. This allows the decorator to work with functions that
take any number of positional and/or keyword arguments. You'll see this pattern used a lot with wrapper functions, as
they are essentially a bridge between the decorator and the function it is decorating — the arguments must flow through
the wrapper to get to the decorated function.

## Real-world examples

These are some of the more common real-world examples I've come across while developing Python applications.

### Timing functions

Here's a practical decorator that measures how long a function takes to execute:

```python
import time
from functools import wraps

def timer(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs) # evaluate the function
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds to run")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer
def slow_function():
    time.sleep(1)
    print("Function finished!")
```

### Caching results

Counting the fibonacci sequence is a classic example of a function that is well suited to caching. The naive recursive
implementation is very slow for large values of `n`, but the cached version is extremely fast. Let's look at the naïve (slow) version first:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n < 2:  # Base cases: fib(0) = 0, fib(1) = 1
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

If you try to run this function for large values of `n`, you'll notice that it takes a long time to complete. This
implementation is considered "naïve" because it recalculates the same values many times. For example, to calculate
`fibonacci(5)`, it will calculate `fibonacci(2)` three separate times! This redundant calculation makes it slower and
slower the bigger the `n` you give it. Now, let's try storing the results of the function for future use in a dictionary
so that we don't have to recalculate them:

```python
from functools import wraps

def cache(func):
    stored_results = {}
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args):
        if args in stored_results:
            return stored_results[args]
        result = func(*args)
        stored_results[args] = result
        return result
    return wrapper

@cache
def fibonacci(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

Now if we use this decorated version of the same code, it will be considerably faster.

## Class decorators

Decorators are not limited to functions — they can also be used with classes:

```python
from functools import wraps

def singleton(cls):
    instances = {}
    @wraps(cls)
    def get_instance(*args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in instances:
            instances[cls] = cls(*args, **kwargs)
        return instances[cls]

    return get_instance

@singleton
class Configuration:
    def __init__(self):
        self.settings = {}
```

In this case, the `@singleton` decorator ensures that only one instance of the `Configuration` class is created and
shared across the program.

## Built-in decorators

The Python standard library provides several built-in decorators:

### `@property`

Sometimes you need to compute attributes of objects on the fly, and it would be helpful to access them as attributes
instead of as methods, since it can be somewhat more ergonomic:

```python
class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self._radius = radius # the underscore indicates to users that this is a "private" variable

    @property
    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self._radius ** 2

circle = Circle(5)
print(circle.area)  # Accessed like an attribute, not circle.area()
```

### `@classmethod`

Class methods are methods that receive the class itself as the first argument (usually named `cls` by convention)
instead of the instance (`self`). They can be used to create alternative constructors or perform operations that need
access to class attributes but don't need instance-specific data. Here's an example using a `Date` class that you can
use to create dates from a series of arguments (year, month, day), a string, or by calling the `today` class method:

```python
class Date:
    def __init__(self, year, month, day):
        self.year = year
        self.month = month
        self.day = day

    @classmethod
    def from_string(cls, date_string):
        # Alternative constructor that creates a Date from a string
        year, month, day = map(int, date_string.split('-'))
        return cls(year, month, day)

    @classmethod
    def today(cls):
        # Another alternative constructor using current date
        import datetime
        today = datetime.datetime.now()
        return cls(today.year, today.month, today.day)

# Using the class methods
date1 = Date.from_string('2024-03-20')
date2 = Date.today()
```

Class methods are particularly useful when you need multiple ways to create instances of your class (as above) or when
you want to modify class-level attributes.

### `@staticmethod`

Static methods are methods that don't receive any automatic first argument. They behave just like regular functions,
except for the fact that they happen to live in the class's namespace. They're useful when you have a method that
doesn't need access to instance or class attributes. I think of them as a way to group related functions together in a
class. They could have just as easily been defined outside of a class and live as free floating functions, but grouping
things in this way can be useful for readability and organization. Here's an example using a `MathOperations` class that
has two static methods for checking if a number is even and for calculating the factorial of a number recursively:

```python
class MathOperations:
    @staticmethod
    def is_even(number):
        return number % 2 == 0

    @staticmethod
    def factorial(n):
        if n <= 1:
            return 1
        return n * MathOperations.factorial(n - 1)

# Using static methods (no instance needed)
print(MathOperations.is_even(4))  # True
print(MathOperations.factorial(5))  # 120
```

Lastly, let's make an `Example` class that showcases the differences between the three types of methods:

Here's an example showing the difference between regular methods, class methods, and static methods:

```python
class Example:
    class_var = "I'm a class variable"

    def __init__(self):
        self.instance_var = "I'm an instance variable"

    def regular_method(self):
        print(f"Regular methods can access instance: {self.instance_var}")
        print(f"and class vars: {self.class_var}")

    @classmethod
    def class_method(cls):
        print(f"Class methods can access class vars: {cls.class_var}")
        # Can't access instance_var because there's no instance

    @staticmethod
    def static_method():
        print("Static methods can't directly access instance or class vars")
        # Could access Example.class_var, but that's not considered good practice

# Usage
ex = Example()
ex.regular_method()      # All three ways work for regular methods
Example.regular_method(ex)
Example.regular_method(Example())

Example.class_method()   # Both ways work for class methods
ex.class_method()

Example.static_method()  # Both ways work for static methods
ex.static_method()
```

Regular methods are by far the most common type of method in Python, and are the type you should probably use most of
the time. However, you should consider using the other two types of methods when they are appropriate (e.g. using
`@staticmethod` for utility functions that don't need access to instance or class attributes).

## Summary

Decorators are a powerful way to modify or enhance functions and classes in Python. They allow you to add functionality
to existing code progressively, without needing to change what you've already written very much. It's relatively
unlikely that you will need to write your own decorators for this particular class, but at the very least I hope you are
now a more savvy consumer of this feature.
