# 8.8. Common Pitfalls

Even experienced programmers make mistakes! Here are some common pitfalls to watch out for, along
with ways to avoid them.

Note that, like 8.7 before it, this is section is designed more like a cheat sheet than as a
comprehensive guide to every possible pitfall you might encounter. Feel free to skim it, and come
back to it as needed. I will update this section as I encounter more common "gotchas" within the
language.

## Naming conflicts

One of the most insidious bugs you can create is a **naming conflict**. This happens when you give something (like a file or variable) the same name as something else that's already defined in Python.

### Local files vs. library names

Imagine that you are working on a project that uses the `random` module. However, in your project folder, you inadvertently create a file named `random.py` and put some code in it.

```python
# You create a file named random.py somewhere in your project
# Inside of your random.py file, you have a function that returns the number 42
def get_number():
    return 42

# Now, in another file somewhere in your project, you try to use the random module
import random
# This will fail! Python finds your local random.py instead of the standard library random module!

random_number = random.randint(1, 10)  # AttributeError: module 'random' has no attribute 'randint'
```

To avoid this, **don't name your files the same as Python standard library modules or popular third-party packages**. Some common ones to avoid:

- `random.py`
- `math.py`
- `test.py`
- `json.py`
- `datetime.py`
- `tkinter.py`
- `requests.py`
- `numpy.py`
- `pandas.py`
- `scipy.py`
- `matplotlib.py`
- `seaborn.py`
- `sklearn.py`

### Variable shadowing

Python comes with a lot of built-in functions and variables. If you try to use a variable name that's already defined in
Python, it will **shadow** (aka overwrite) the built-in function or variable, making it **inaccessible**. (Also see the
section on [variable scoping](#scoping-issues) below for more on this issue.)

```python
# Built-in function shadowing
list = [1, 2, 3]  # Oops! Now 'list' refers to your variable, not the list constructor!
new_list = list([4, 5, 6])  # TypeError: 'list' object is not callable

# Function parameter shadowing
def process_data(data, filter):
    # Oops! 'filter' now refers to the parameter, not the built-in filter() function
    filtered = filter(lambda x: x > 0, data)  # TypeError: 'list' object is not callable
```

## Mutable default arguments

This is a classic Python pitfall many beginners fall prey to; it's quite insidious. When you use a
_mutable object_ (like a list or dictionary) as a _default argument_, it's created once (and only
once!) when the function is defined — it does not create it anew each time the function is called.
In a sane world, it would be created anew each time the function is called, but alas, this is the
world we live in.

Instead of using a mutable object as a default argument, you should use `None` as the default and
create the object inside the function after checking if it's `None`.

```python
# Bad: The same list is shared between all function calls!
def add_item(item, items=[]):
    items.append(item)
    return items

print(add_item(1))  # [1]
print(add_item(2))  # [1, 2] -- Oops! The list is accumulating items

# Good: Use None as the default and create the list inside the function
def add_item(item, items=None):
    if items is None:
        items = []
    items.append(item)
    return items

print(add_item(1))  # [1]
print(add_item(2))  # [2] -- Good! The list is created anew each time the function is called
```

## Indentation errors

Python uses indentation (four spaces, or a tab) to define blocks of code. Inconsistent indentation
can lead to subtle bugs or syntax errors.

```python
def process_data(data):
    if data:
        result = []
        for item in data:
           result.append(item * 2)  # Notice the different indentation (3 spaces instead of 8)
        return result  # This might look right but can cause issues
    return None

# Use consistent indentation (preferably 4 spaces per level)
def process_data(data):
    if data:
        result = []
        for item in data:
            result.append(item * 2)  # Consistent 4-space indentation
        return result
    return None
```

Even more insidious are **logical indentation errors**, where the code is syntactically correct but does something different than you expect, leading to **semantic errors**.

```python
# This code has a bug! Can you spot it?
def calculate_totals(items):
    total = 0
    for item in items:
        if item > 0:
            total += item
            print(f"Added {item} to total")
        return total  # Oops! This is indented at the wrong level

# The return statement is *inside* the if block, so the function
# returns after processing just one positive item!

# Here's the corrected version:
def calculate_totals(items):
    total = 0
    for item in items:
        if item > 0:
            total += item
            print(f"Added {item} to total")
    return total  # Now properly indented outside the loop, so all items are processed

# Try them both:
items = [1, 2, -3, 4]
print(calculate_totals(items))  # First version returns 1
                                # Second version returns 7 (1 + 2 + 4)
```

These logical indentation errors can be particularly tricky because the code runs without syntax
errors — it just doesn't do what you expect! Always check your indentation carefully when debugging
unexpected behavior.

## Missing punctuation

I cannot count the number of times that I or others have written code that is "logically" correct, but fails either
syntactically or semantically because of a missing punctuation mark. Most of the time, you (or your editor) can easily
catch syntax errors like these:

```python
# This code will fail because of a missing colon
if x > 0
    print("x is positive")
```

But what about something more pernicious, like a missing comma in a list?

```python
# This code will fail because of a missing comma
names = [
    "John",
    "Jane",
    "Jim",
    "Jill"
    "Jake"
]
print(names)  # ['John', 'Jane', 'Jim', 'JillJake']
```

Because Python has **implicit string concatenation** (when two strings side by side without a comma or plus sign between
them become concatenated), the code above will actually run just fine. However, it will only produce a list of 4 names,
not 5. This is a subtle semantic bug that can be hard to spot. Remain vigilant in your use of punctuation!

## Circular imports

When two modules import each other, it creates a circular import that can lead to confusing errors.

```python
# file1.py
from file2 import function2

def function1():
    return function2()

# file2.py
from file1 import function1  # Oops! This creates a circular import!

def function2():
    return function1()
```

To fix this, you should:

1. Restructure your code to avoid the circular dependency. This is the best solution! For example:

   - Move the shared functionality to a third module that both files can import
   - Combine the related functionality into a single module (perhaps a single class)
   - Rethink the design from first principles to eliminate the circular relationship

2. If restructuring isn't possible, move the import inside the function where it's needed:

```python
# file1.py
def function1():
    from file2 import function2  # Import inside the function
    return function2()

# file2.py
def function2():
    from file1 import function1  # Import inside the function
    return function1()
```

While this works, it's not ideal because (a) it makes the dependencies less obvious, (b) it can make
your code slower (imports are executed each time the function is called), and (c) it's harder to
understand what modules your code depends on.

The best solution is almost always to restructure your code to eliminate the circular dependency
entirely.

## Shallow vs. deep copying

Python variables hold _references_ to objects, _not_ the objects themselves. This can lead to
unexpected behavior with mutable objects. For example, if you copy a list, the copy is a reference
to the original list, and does not create a brand new list with copies of all the items inside. When
dealing with such mutable objects, you can use the `copy` module to create a "deep copy" (with
`copy.deepcopy()`) that creates a brand new list with copies of all the items inside.

```python
# List copying pitfall
original = [1, 2, [3, 4]]
copy = original.copy()  # Creates a shallow copy

copy[2][0] = 'three'
print(original[2][0])  # Oops — prints 'three'! The nested list is still referenced

# Use deep copy for nested structures
from copy import deepcopy
copy = deepcopy(original)
copy[2][0] = 'three'
print(copy[2][0])  # 'three'
print(original[2][0])  # Still 3, as expected
```

## String concatenation in loops

Recall that strings are immutable. This means they cannot be changed. If you try to build complex
strings by concatenation in a loop, you'll create a new string object in each iteration, which is
highly inefficient. Instead, you should use a list to collect the strings and then join them at the
end.

```python
# Bad: Creates a new string object in each iteration — slow and memory-intensive
result = ""
for i in range(1000):
    result += str(i)

# Good: Use join() or list comprehension
result = "".join(str(i) for i in range(1000))
```

## Scoping issues

Consider the following code:

```python
def my_function():
    x = 10
    print(x)

print(x)  # Oops! NameError: name 'x' is not defined
```

For beginners, this can be confusing because it seems like `x` should be accessible everywhere. You defined it, already,
right? But in Python, the scope of a variable is limited to the block in which it is defined. In this case, `x` is
defined inside of `my_function()`, so it is not accessible outside of that function. If, however, it had been defined
outside of the function, in the main body of the file, it would have been in the _global scope_ and thus accessible
everywhere. Consider the following example, where we have two variables with the same name: a global variable `x` and a
local variable `x` inside of a function:

```python
x = 10 # this is a global variable

def my_function():
    x = 20  # this is a local variable
    print(x)

my_function()  # prints 20 -- the local x
print(x)  # prints 10 -- the global x
```

This is why you should be careful about using the same variable name for different purposes in different scopes! It can
lead to behavior that you might not anticipate.

There are four possible scopes for a variable, and when you access a variable with a given name, Python will use the
variable with the _innermost_ scope. The scopes are commonly reffered to by the acronym LEGB:

1. **L**ocal scope: The variable is defined inside of the _current_ function.
2. **E**nclosing scope: The variable is defined inside of any _parent_ functions.
3. **G**lobal scope: The variable is defined outside of any functions, in the main body of the file.
4. **B**uilt-in scope: The variable is defined in the built-in functions and variables (e.g., `print`, `len`, `range`, etc.).

Python will always use the first variable it finds with the given name, starting from the innermost scope and working
its way outwards.

### Global variables

At your peril, you can manually _break_ these scoping rules by using special keywords. One such (dangerous) keyword is
`global`.

```python
# Bad: Global variable
counter = 0

def increment_counter():
    global counter  # This explicitly tells Python to use the counter variable in the global scope
    counter += 1
    return counter

counter = increment_counter()


# Better: Pass the value as a parameter
counter = 0

def increment_counter(value):
    return value + 1

counter = increment_counter(counter)
```

I would strongly recommend against using `global` variables (or `nonlocal` ones for that matter, too). Instead, I
recommend passing variables as arguments to functions, and returning any modified value from the function. Global
variables often seem attractive to novices — believe me, I put them everywhere in the beginning — but they are a source
of nigh endless headaches due to the difficulty of reasoning about their behavior.

## Failing to close files

Forgetting to close files can lead to resource leaks! To get around this, you can use a context manager, which handles
the proper behavior for entering and exiting the block.

```python
# Bad: File might not get closed if an error occurs
f = open('data.txt', 'r')
data = f.read()
f.close()

# Good: Use a context manager
with open('data.txt', 'r') as f:
    data = f.read()
# File is automatically closed after the with block!
```

## Return statement misuse

One of the most common mistakes beginners make involves the `return` statement - either using it incorrectly or
forgetting to use it entirely.

### Forgetting to return values

When a function doesn't explicitly return anything, it implicitly returns `None`. This can lead to unexpected behavior:

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    result = a + b
    # Oops! Forgot to return result

sum = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(sum)  # Prints None, not 8!

# Fixed version:
def add_numbers(a, b):
    result = a + b
    return result  # Now it returns the actual sum

result = add_numbers(5, 3) # puts 8 into the result variable
print(result)  # Prints 8 in the terminal, as expected
```

Remember that every function in Python returns a value! If you don't explicitly return a value, the function will return
`None`. The humble `print` statement is a function, too, and it returns `None`. Unfortunately, people often try to save
the result of `print` in a variable, when in fact they want to use the value they put inside of `print` instead.

```python
def greet():
    greeting = print("Hello, world!") # oops! We are not putting the string into the greeting variable!
    return greeting # this is None!

result = greet()  # Prints "Hello, world!" to the terminal, but puts `None` into the result variable
print(result)  # shows nothing in the terminal here — but because we saw "Hello, world!" in the terminal before, we may be confused!
```

### Using return outside functions

Another common mistake is trying to use `return` statements outside of the body of a function.
Recall that return statements are used to return a value from a function. If you try to use a return
statement outside of a function, you will get a `SyntaxError`.

```python
# script.py
x = 5 + 3
return x  # SyntaxError: 'return' outside function

# Correct way - wrap it in a function:
def calculate():
    x = 5 + 3
    return x

# If you want to run this code when the script is executed directly:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = calculate()
    print(result)
```

This error sometimes occurs in combination with the logical [indentation errors](#indentation-errors) mentioned above!

```python
# This code has a bug! Can you spot it?
def calculate_totals(items):
    total = 0
    for item in items:
        if item > 0:
            total += item
            print(f"Added {item} to total")
return total  # Oops! This is indented at the wrong level -- in this case, it's outside the function!

# This will yield a SyntaxError!

# Here's the corrected version:
def calculate_totals(items):
    total = 0
    for item in items:
        if item > 0:
            total += item
            print(f"Added {item} to total")
    return total  # Now properly indented within the function, but after the loop, so all items are processed
```

The `if __name__ == "__main__":` statement is crucial here because it helps distinguish between:

- When your file is being run directly as a script (e.g., if you have a `script.py` file and run it via `python script.py` from your terminal)
- When your file is being imported as a module by another file (e.g., if you have a `helper.py` file and run `import
helper` from within another file)

Without this statement, any code at the module level (outside functions) will run immediately when the file is imported,
which can lead to unexpected behavior. Let's look at an example where this matters.

```python
# within your helper.py file
def useful_function():
    return "I'm helpful!"

print("This will run when helper.py is imported!")  # Probably not what we want

# within your main.py file
import helper  # Oops! The print statement in helper.py runs immediately!
# This might not be what we intended...


# Here's a better version of helper.py:
def useful_function():
    return "I'm helpful!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # This only runs if helper.py is run directly
    print("Running helper.py as a script")
    print(useful_function())
```

Remember: If you need code to run when your file is executed directly (but not when it's imported), put that code inside
the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.

### Scripts that do nothing

Often, I see students write scripts that just define a number of functions without calling them. If you do not call or invoke the functions, nothing will happen.

```python
# Bad: This code will do nothing when it is run
# This is the whole file.
def main():
    # your code goes here

# there is no output when you run this script!
```

To avoid this pitfall, start a new script by writing a function called `main()` which will contain the primary logic of
the program, and then call that function from the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block. Otherwise, if you just define some
functions but don't call them, nothing will happen when you run the script!

```python
# Better: write the main function and then call it within the if __name__ == "__main__": block
def main():
    # your code goes here

# This will now run the main function when you run the script
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## File path issues

File paths can be a major source of confusion and bugs, especially when sharing code between different computers or
operating systems. Here are some common pitfalls to watch out for:

### Absolute and relative paths

Avoid the use of **absolute paths** because they only work on your specific machine. This is a problem when you share your
code with others, or when you run it on a different machine (or one with a different operating system).

```python
# Bad: This will only work on your machine!
data = open("C:/Users/stefan/Documents/data.txt", "r")

# Bad: This will break on Windows!
data = open("/home/stefan/data.txt", "r")
```

Instead, use **relative paths**, which are relative to the **current working directory** (where you run the script from),
**not** where the script file is located. This can lead to confusion:

```python
# Let's say you have this structure:
# project/
#   ├── data/
#   │   └── input.txt
#   └── scripts/
#       └── process.py

# Inside process.py:
with open("data/input.txt", "r") as f:  # Beware!
    data = f.read()
```

As written, this code will only work if you run the script from the `project/` directory:

```bash
cd project
python scripts/process.py
```

It will fail if you run it from anywhere else, including the `scripts/` directory:

```bash
cd project/scripts
python process.py  # FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory: 'data/input.txt'
```

### Solutions

1. Use `os.path.join()` for cross-platform compatibility:

```python
import os

# This works on both Windows and Unix-like systems
path = os.path.join("data", "input.txt")
with open(path, "r") as f:
    data = f.read()
```

2. Use `pathlib` (modern approach):

```python
from pathlib import Path

# This works on both Windows and Unix-like systems
path = Path("data") / "input.txt"
with open(path, "r") as f:
    data = f.read()
```

3. If you need to reference files relative to the script's location (not the working directory), use `__file__`:

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path

# Get the directory containing the script
script_dir = Path(__file__).parent

# Now this will work regardless of where you run the script from
data_path = script_dir / "data" / "input.txt"
with open(data_path, "r") as f:
    data = f.read()
```

Remember: When sharing code, always use relative paths and make sure to document the expected directory structure. If
you need to use absolute paths for testing, be sure to define that information in your environment variables or
configuration files such that they can be easily modified by other users. (But never, ever commit your secret
information files [e.g., `.env`] to version control!)

## Attitude issues

It might seem strange to include a section on "attitude" in a list of common programming pitfalls, but your mindset can
significantly impact your learning journey and problem-solving abilities.

One common hurdle, especially for beginners, is the tendency to "fight" the computer. You might be utterly convinced
that your logic is flawless and the machine is somehow mistaken or being difficult. Remember: **the computer only ever
does exactly what you tell it to do.** If the output is unexpected, it's almost certainly because your instructions (the
code) don't quite match your intentions.

Instead of frustration, try to approach these situations with humility and a spirit of cooperation and learning. View
the computer not as an adversary, but as a very literal-minded partner that's giving you precise feedback on your
instructions. When something goes wrong, it's an opportunity to learn more deeply about how the language works or how
your logic needs refinement. Adopting this perspective will make debugging less stressful and ultimately help you become
a more effective programmer.

## Conclusion

Remember, these pitfalls are common enough that most Python developers (including myself!) have encountered them at some
point. You probably will, too! The key is not to try to avoid every possible mistake, because that's impossible and
counter-productive. I expect that you will actually learn more slowly if you try to be too defensive. Instead, we strive
to learn from our mistakes to develop good habits that help us avoid them in the future.
