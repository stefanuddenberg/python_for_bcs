# 6.5. Turtle

Lastly, before we get to the lab/homework, we'll go over the basics of `turtle`, so that you can use
it to create your own simulations.

### The Turtle library

The turtle library in python lets you create pictures and shapes by providing them with a virtual canvas. It is all
drawn by creating instances of a "turtle" object on a drawing canvas.

```python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle() # Create a turtle object
t.forward(100) # Move the turtle forward
t.right(90) # Rotate the turtle right by 90 degrees
t.forward(100) # Move the turtle forward again
t.left(45) # Rotate the turtle left by 45 degrees
t.backward(100) # Move the turtle backward
turtle.mainloop() # keeps the turtle window from closing at the end
```

Turtle can be used to draw pictures in all sorts of fun algorithmic ways:

```python
import turtle

# Create a turtle object
t = turtle.Turtle()

# Define the colors for each petal
colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "indigo", "violet", "purple"]

# Loop to draw each petal
for color in colors:
    # Set the pen color for the current petal
    t.pencolor(color)

    # Draw a petal
    t.forward(100)
    t.left(45)
    t.forward(100)
    t.left(135)
    t.forward(100)
    t.left(45)
    t.forward(100)
    t.left(135)

    # Rotate to the next petal position
    t.left(45)

t.hideturtle() # Hide the turtle
turtle.mainloop()
```

### Turtle Attributes and Methods

A turtle is a class, and the line `t = turtle.Turtle()` creates an instance of that class, which
places it the center of a window. Turtle objects have attributes like their shape, size, and color,
and they have methods like `forward()`, `backward()`, `left()`, `right()`, and many more.

Here are some examples of the attributes and methods for Turtle objects:

```python
import turtle

# Create turtle objects
t1 = turtle.Turtle()
t2 = turtle.Turtle()

t1.speed(3)  # Change the speed attribute
t1.color("blue")  # Change the color attribute
t1.pensize(3)  # Change the pensize attribute
t1.setpos(100, 100)  # Change the position attribute, without drawing if pen is down
t1.goto(100, 200)  # change the position attribute, drawing along the way
t1.setheading(90)  # Change the heading attribute
t1.penup()  # Change the "isdown" attribute to false, which will stop the turtle from drawing if it moves
t1.pendown()  # Change the "isdown" attribute to True, which will make the turtle draw
t1.showturtle()  # make the turtle visible
t1.hideturtle()  # make the turtle invisible

# load a custom graphic into turtle
turtle.register_shape("path/to/your/image.gif") # replace that string with wherever the image is
t1.shape("path/to/your/image.gif")  # set your turtle to the custom graphic located on your computer

# Some turtle methods can take another turtle as an argument
# Calculate the angle from t1 towards t2
angle = t1.towards(t2)
print("Angle from t1 towards t2:", angle)

dist = t1.distance(t2)
print("Distance from t1 to t2:", dist)

t1.setheading(angle) # point t1 in the direction angle, which will point it at t2
t1.forward(dist)  # will move t1 forward the distance between it and t2
```

Sometimes, with more complex graphics, you may want to create a screen object and then create turtles on that screen, otherwise you may find that the program runs too slowly.

```python
screen = turtle.Screen()
screen.tracer(0) # turn off automatic screen updates -- we'll tell it when to update
t1 = turtle.Turtle()
t2 = turtle.Turtle()

# Assume we have logic to do a bunch of stuff with t1 and t2 here...
...

# Then, when ready, update the screen to make it refresh and show the changes
screen.update()
```
