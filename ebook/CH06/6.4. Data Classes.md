# 6.4. Data Classes

Data classes, introduced in Python 3.7, provide a concise way to create classes that are primarily used to store data.
They automatically generate several special methods, such as `__init__()`, `__repr__()`, and `__eq__()`, allowing us to
write more readable code with less boilerplate. But before we can talk about data classes, we need to talk about type
hints (albeit briefly).

## Type hints

Type hints are a way to tell the Python interpreter what type of data a variable is. They are optional, but they can
help us catch errors at runtime, and they can help us understand the code better. Here's a simple example of a type hint:

```python
name: str = "Alice"
age: int = 30
is_alive: bool = True
```

In this example, we are telling the our code editor that the `name` variable is a string, `age` is an integer, and so
on. If we try to assign a different type of data than expected to such type hinted variables, your code editor will
point out the error (e.g., with squiggly red underlines).

Type hints are also optional when writing data classes, but they're strongly recommended as they help us catch errors
quicker and make the code more readable (since it's essentially self-documentation).

You can also use type hints for more advanced data types, such as lists, dictionaries, and tuples, or even custom
classes.

```python
name: str = "Alice"
age: int = 30
is_alive: bool = True

favorite_colors: list[str] = ["red", "blue", "green"]
favorite_numbers: dict[str, int] = {"Alice": 1, "Bob": 2, "Charlie": 3}
# assume the existence of an Animal class declared earlier
favorite_animal: Animal = Animal("Dog", True, True, True)
```

Don't stress too much over type hints as they are optional and you can always add them later. We also touch on type
hints in Chapter 8, and you can read more about them in the
[Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html).

## Basic data class

Here's a simple example of a data class:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Animal:
    name: str
    is_alive: bool
    can_move: bool
    can_grow: bool
```

These few lines of code are equivalent to writing all of this:

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name: str, is_alive: bool, can_move: bool, can_grow: bool):
        self.name = name
        self.is_alive = is_alive
        self.can_move = can_move
        self.can_grow = can_grow

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Animal(name={self.name}, is_alive={self.is_alive}, can_move={self.can_move}, can_grow={self.can_grow})"

    def __eq__(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, Animal):
            return NotImplemented
        return (self.name, self.is_alive, self.can_move, self.can_grow) == (
            other.name,
            other.is_alive,
            other.can_move,
            other.can_grow,
        )
```

## Features and options

### Default values

Data classes can have default values, which can be quite helpful:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Rectangle:
    width: float
    height: float = 1.0  # default value given if none is provided
    color: str = "white"

my_rectangle = Rectangle(width=10) # width is required, but height and color have defaults
print(my_rectangle) # prints out:Rectangle(width=10, height=1.0, color='white')
```

### Frozen instances

You can keep the data in your data class from changing (i.e. make your class immutable) by using the `frozen=True`
option:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Configuration:
    host: str
    port: int = 8080

my_configuration = Configuration(host="localhost")

```

Attempting to modify a frozen instance will raise `FrozenInstanceError`.

```python
my_configuration.host = "127.0.0.1" # dataclasses.FrozenInstanceError: cannot assign to field 'host'
```

### Post-init processing

Although you won't generally want to write an `__init__` method for every data class, you can use the `__post_init__`
method to perform additional initialization beyond the default.

```python
@dataclass
class Person:
    first_name: str
    last_name: str
    full_name: str | None = None # type hint meaning that `full_name` can be a string or the value `None`

    def __post_init__(self):
        if self.full_name is None:
            self.full_name = f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name}"


person = Person(first_name="John", last_name="Doe")
print(person) # prints out: Person(first_name='John', last_name='Doe', full_name='John Doe')
```

### Field options

The `field()` function provides additional control over fields, allowing you to specify more complex default values on
creation. For example, consider a `Student` class where we want to automatically assign an id number to each student. We can accomplish this with data classes like this:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field

@dataclass
class Student:
    name: str
    grades: list[int] = field(
        default_factory=list
    )  # Use default_factory for mutable defaults
    id: int = field(init=False, default=0)  # Field not included in __init__ -- don't provide it at creation!
    _id_counter: int = 0 # private field to keep track of the current id

    def __post_init__(self):
        # Assign the current id_counter to the id field and increment it
        self.id = self._id_counter
        self._id_counter += 1


alex = Student(name="Alex")
print(alex) # prints out: Student(name='Alex', grades=[], id=0)

bill = Student(name="Bill")
print(bill) # prints out: Student(name='Bill', grades=[], id=1) # notice that the id is automatically assigned

charlie = Student(name="Charlie", grades=[95, 87, 92])
print(charlie) # prints out: Student(name='Charlie', grades=[95, 87, 92], id=2)
```

## When to use data classes

Data classes are ideal when:

- You need a simple class to hold data
- You want automatic generation of special methods
- You need immutable objects

They might not be the best choice when:

- You need complex inheritance hierarchies
- Your class requires significant custom behavior
- You need to control the initialization process precisely

## Comparison with other approaches

### Named tuples

Named tuples are immutable and more lightweight, but less flexible than data classes.

```python
from collections import namedtuple

Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])
p = Point(x=10, y=20)
print(p) # prints out: Point(x=10, y=20)
```

### Regular classes

Regular classes offer more control and flexibility (esp. with inheritance) but require more boilerplate code to
accomplish the same result.

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name: str, age: int):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, name: str, age: int, grade: int):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.grade = grade
```

Data classes provide a sweet spot between named tuples and regular classes, offering both convenience and flexibility.

## Best practices

1. Use type hints consistently
   - Type hints take the form `variable_name: type_name = my_variable_value`
   - e.g., `name: str = "Alex"`
2. Consider _freezing_ your data classes if they represent data that should not change
3. Use `field(default_factory=list)` for mutable default values (like collections)
4. You can always implement a `__post_init__` method for more complex initialization logic
5. Use "vanilla" (regular) classes for more complex cases that involve inheritance or more complex behavior

## Summary

Data classes are a powerful feature in Python that simplify the creation of classes primarily used for storing data.
They reduce boilerplate code while providing useful functionality like automatic method generation, immutability
options, and type hints support. When used appropriately, they can make code more concise, readable, and maintainable.
