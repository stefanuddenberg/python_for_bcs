# 14.1. Loading and saving `DataFrames`

## Loading files into a `pandas` `DataFrame`

Once you have `pandas` installed, you'll need a dataset to work with. We will be using a dataset collected in order to
understand children's vocabulary development. It's stored as a single CSV file, and has a lot of different variables
represented as columns (e.g., the frequencies of words, the percentage of kids who say those words).
The data can be found [here](../data/lab10/predict_mcdi.csv). Here is what the first few lines of the file look like:

```text
Age,Word,Lexical_Class,MCIDp,LogFreq,ProKWo
16,a,function_words,0.035564854,4.432119101,0.093587561
17,a,function_words,0.043956044,4.466571072,0.106887602
17,a,function_words,0.04395604,4.466571072,0.106887602
18,a,function_words,0.07918552,4.535028144,0.171016303
19,a,function_words,0.1036585,4.580457373,0.220025328
20,a,function_words,0.1167883,4.635242405,0.243169211
21,a,function_words,0.1773399,4.677962637,0.273148016
22,a,function_words,0.28,4.714002658,0.379545093
```

Each row of data represents a single word at a single age, and the values in the columns are:

1. `Age`: the age of the children, in months
2. `Word`: the word that the rest of the data is about
3. `Lexical_Class`: the grammatical part of speech of that word
4. `MCDIp`: The percentage of children who, at that age, say that word
5. `LogFreq`: the cumulative log frequency of that word in a dataset of speech to childen, up to that age
6. `ProKWo`: the percentage of that word's co-occurrences that, at that age, are estimated to be with other words that
   children of that age already know.

The dataset has data about 500 words at 15 different ages (age 16-30 months), resulting in 7500 rows (plus the header
row).

Previously, we might have used the `csv` module or written our own code to read that in as a list of list, or maybe as a
dictionary. The `pandas` module provides various functions to load different types of data, such as CSV, Excel, JSON,
and SQL datasets. To load CSV data into a `DataFrame`, use the `read_csv()` function as shown below:

```python
import pandas as pd
file_name = "/path/to/predict_mcdi.csv"  # path to the file relative to where the script this code is
mcdi_df = pd.read_csv(file_name)
```

Here, `pd.read_csv` calls the `read_csv` function from the `pandas` library (which is imported with the alias `pd`). The
CSV file `predict_mcdi.csv` is passed as an argument to this function, and the returned output is assigned to the
variable `mcdi_df`.

We can see what the data actually looks like if we just print the data structure:

```python
print(mcdi_df)
```

If you run the above code, you will see:

```text
      Age    Word   Lexical_Class     MCDIp   LogFreq    ProKWo
0      16       a  function_words  0.035565  4.432119  0.093588
1      17       a  function_words  0.043956  4.466571  0.106888
2      18       a  function_words  0.079186  4.535028  0.171016
3      19       a  function_words  0.103659  4.580457  0.220025
4      20       a  function_words  0.116788  4.635242  0.243169
...   ...     ...             ...       ...       ...       ...
7495   26  zipper           nouns  0.629834  2.363612  0.571920
7496   27  zipper           nouns  0.610256  2.374748  0.595180
7497   28  zipper           nouns  0.769134  2.385606  0.724979
7498   29  zipper           nouns  0.671717  2.406540  0.668059
7499   30  zipper           nouns  0.820339  2.416641  0.775563

[7500 rows x 6 columns]
```

You can see that `pandas` shows us a line number for each row of data. a preview of the first and last rows, and
finishes by telling us how many rows and columns were in our dataset.

## Specifying load options

The `read_csv` function can take a bunch of other optional parameters which may be useful depending on the nature of the
dataset. Here's an example of using some of these options with read_csv:

```python
mcdi_df = pd.read_csv(
    "predict_mcdi.csv", # the input file name, a required argument
    sep=",", # Specify the delimiter used to separate fields in the input file. By default, it is set to ","
    header=None, # the row number to use as column names, default is 0. If None, names will be auto-generated
    index_col=None, # the column to set as the index (row labels) of the DataFrame
    skiprows=1, # The number of rows to skip from the start of the file
    nrows=150,  # The number of rows to read from the file
    names=None, # specifying a list of header names if you don't have them in the file
    dtype={'Word': str, 'MCDIp': float, 'LogFreq': float, 'ProKWo': float} # if you want to specify the column data type
)
```

For a complete list of options, you can refer to the `pandas` documentation on `read_csv`:
https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html

## Handling different file formats

`pandas` can load data from a variety of file formats, such as Excel, JSON, and SQL. To load data from these formats,
you can use the corresponding functions, as shown below:

```python
my_df = pd.read_excel("some_excel_file.xlsx") # Loading Excel data
my_df = pd.read_json("some_json_file.json") # Loading JSON data
```

For more information on loading data from different formats, refer to the `pandas` documentation on I/O tools:
https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html

## Saving a `DataFrame` to file:

After processing and analyzing the data, you may want to save the resulting DataFrame to a file. `pandas` provides the
`to_csv()`, `to_excel()`, and other methods for this purpose.

```python
# Save DataFrame to a CSV file
mcdi_df.to_csv('output.csv', index=False) # index=False means we don't want to save the row numbers themselves as a column

# Save DataFrame to an Excel file
mcdi_df.to_excel('output.xlsx', index=False)
```
