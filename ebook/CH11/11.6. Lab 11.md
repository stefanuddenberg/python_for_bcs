# 11.6. Lab 11

Tip: In addition to Chapter 11, some helpful past sections are 3.4 and 3.5 (for the main function)
and 6.0 to 6.4.

In this lab, we'll create a simple animation of a runner moving across the screen, whose speed can be adjusted using a
slider.

1. Create a program with a `main` function that is called if the script is not imported. This will contain the main
   logic of the program.
2. Above that main function, at the top level of the scope of the file, create a class called `Display`. Within its
   `__init__` method, create an attribute called `root` that creates a tkinter window. This will control the display.
3. Within your `main` function, create an instance of `Display` called `my_display`, and call `my_display.root.mainloop()` so
   the window doesn't close. As a result, there should only be 2 lines of code under your `main` function.

4. Create another method in your `Display` class called `init_window()`. This method will be called from `Display`'s
   `__init__` method. Have that method:

   - rename the window "Runner"
   - use a _class attribute_ called `screen_size`, set to (800,600), to configure the size of the tkinter window
   - create two frames in the window, one called `runner_frame` and one called `interface_frame`.
     - Use `.grid()` to position the `interface_frame` at the bottom.
     - Make `interface_frame` 100 pixels tall, and the `runner_frame` the remainder (i.e. 500). But this should be
       computed using the `screen_size` variable â€” do not hard-code (aka type) the number 500 directly into the program!
       This way, if the screen size is changed, the frames will stay the correct size.

5. Create a method for `Display` called `create_interface_frame` that:

   - creates a "Quit" button. When the button is clicked, the application should terminate.
   - creates a "Go!" button. When clicked, it calls another `go()` method (we will create that later)
   - add those buttons to the `interface_frame`
   - Now you get to do some customization: change the appearance of the buttons (size, shape, color, etc.) and arrange
     these buttons in the `interface_frame` in a manner of your choosing.

6. Create a method under `Display` called `create_runner_frame` that:

   - creates a canvas called `action_canvas` and adds it to the `runner_frame`
   - make sure the `action_canvas` occupies the entirety of the frame!
   - Add some text that says "Here is a runner. Click the 'Go!' button to make them run." This text should be centered
     at the top of the canvas.
   - Now you get to do some customization: change the font size, type, and color to a choice of your liking.
   - save the image shown below, and use tkinter to draw the image to the canvas. The image should be centered and below
     the text.

7. Create a method under `Display` called `go()` that is activated by pressing the "Go!" button. This method should:

   - Make the image move horizontally 500 times, each time by 10 pixels.
   - But, if the runner gets to either edge of the screen, have the image start moving in the other direction.

8. Add a _slider widget_ to the `interface_frame` that can be used to change the speed of the runner. (A natural place
   to do this would be in the `create_interface_frame` method.)

   - When the slider is at the far left end, have the runner move 1 pixel every time it moves.
   - When the slider is at the far right, have the runner move 10 pixels every time it moves.
   - Add a text label widget above the slider that says "Runner Speed".
   - Add the two widgets to the `interface_frame`.
