# 11.3. Tkinter widgets

Now that we know how to create windows and organize objects, we can run through some of the most commonly-used widgets
and some of their options. For a more complete list, see here:
[https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)

## Label

### Changing font size and color

We've already introduced the basics of labels, but there are a few more interesting things to cover. Label widgets have
many more options:

```python
import tkinter as tk
main_window = tk.Tk()

new_label = tk.Label(text="pizza",
                     fg = "yellow",
                     bg = "cyan",
                     font = "Helvetica 16 bold italic")
new_label.pack()

main_window.mainloop()
```

### Using images in labels

It is easy to use an image in a tkinter program, you can just attach one to a label widget.

```python
import tkinter as tk

main_window = tk.Tk()

logo = tk.PhotoImage(file="pizza.gif")
image_label = tk.Label(main_window, image=logo)
image_label.pack(side="right")

text_label = tk.Label(main_window,
              justify=tk.LEFT,
              padx = 10,
              text="my favorite food")
text_label.pack(side="left")

main_window.mainloop()
```

## Button Widgets

Many button options can be modified, like its size and shape and properties of the text in the button.

The main use of buttons is to make something in your program happen. Next week we will talk a lot more about creating
functions, but here we will quickly show you how you create a function of your own to do something when a button is
pressed.

Functions start with the `def` command, and then the name of the function followed by parentheses and a colon. Then you
just put the code for the function inside it, tabbed over.

```python
import tkinter as tk

counter = 0

def change_label():
    global counter
    counter += 1
    label2.config(text=str(counter))

main_window = tk.Tk()
main_frame = tk.Frame(main_window, height=200, width=400)
main_frame.pack()

label1 = tk.Label(main_frame, text="The button has been pressed")
label1.place(x=100, y=100)
label2 = tk.Label(main_frame, text=str(counter))
label2.place(x=300, y=100)
label3 = tk.Label(main_frame, text="times!")
label3.place(x=325, y=100)

new_button = tk.Button(main_window, text="Press Me!", command=change_label)
new_button.pack()

main_window.mainloop()
```

We create the function and put the code we want to run inside it. The first line in the function is telling the function
that `counter` is a global variable. A global variable is any variable defined out in the main level of your Python
script, all the way to the left. The second line says that any time the function runs, the `counter` variable should be
incremented by 1. The third line changes the text in `label2` to whatever the value of `counter` is (after converting it to
a string, if you try to use an integer as the text for a label, you will get an error).

## Entry widgets

An entry widget is a way to get text data from the user.

```python
import tkinter as tk

main_window = tk.Tk()

tk.Label(main_window, text="Name").grid(row=0)
tk.Label(main_window, text="Favorite Food").grid(row=1)

name_entry = tk.Entry(main_window, bg="white")
name_entry.grid(row=0, column=1)

food_entry = tk.Entry(main_window, bg="white")
food_entry.grid(row=1, column=1)

main_window.mainloop()
```

![a tkinter window with two text entry fields](../images/tkinter10.png)

To actually get the data and store it in a variable, you would need to pair it with a "Submit" button. The button could
call a function called `def get_entry_data()` that looks like this:

```python
def get_entry_data():
    name = name_entry.get()
    favorite_food = food_entry.get()
```

Entry widgets have a `.get()` method, which you can use to get whatever data is currently typed into them. It will be
stored as a string, so if you are getting number input, you will need to convert it.

In the next section, we'll learn about canvases, which are a special kind of widget that can be used for graphics.
