## 2. Course Description and Learning Objectives

Programming for Experimental Psychology has three primary learning objectives:

- to learn what computer programming is and what one can accomplish using computer programs
- to master the basics of how to write computer programs in the Python programming language, including its syntax and proper
  programming technique and style
- to discuss how computer programs, models, and simulations contribute to research about cognitive science/experimental psychology.

## 3. Course Requirements and Grading

  <br>+/- grades are not given in this class.

### Grade Components

- Labs: 30%
- Homework: 20%
- Final Project: 40%
- Participation and Attendance: 10%
- Bonus Points for Final Project: up to 2% plus possible extension (individual action)
- Bonus Points for Course Feedback: up to 2% (collective action)

I am aware that the above numbers add up to 104%; the bonus points are explained in greater detail below.

### Labs — 30%

Each week we will be spending a considerable portion of our lab time working on various lab exercises. Each lab
assignment is one of the final sections of each chapter in the textbook. Lab assignments should be turned in each week
on the course website. Labs are due each week on Monday at 5pm. They can be turned in by Tuesday at 5pm for a 20%
deduction. After Tuesday at 5pm, they will not be accepted unless you have made prior arrangements.

### Homework — 20%

There are four homework assignments throughout the semester, about every three weeks. The homework assignments involve
creating a single, more complex Python program that achieves some BCOG-related goals. Homework assignments should be
turned in each week on the course website. These homework assignments are due on a Monday at 5pm, and 10% is deducted
for each day they are late.

### Final Project & Final Paper — 40%

The undergraduate version of the final project involves creating a Python program of their choosing of equal or greater
complexity to the homework assignments. As graduate students, your final project will work a little differently. The
goal of the project is to put your Python skills to work in service of your research goals. As such, I will ask you to
write a 10-15 page-long research proposal for an experiment (or series of experiments) that you would like to conduct,
and then implement a draft of that experiment using Python. The rubric for grading the code aspect of the project will
be similar to that found [here](bcog_200_final_project_assignment.md). The code project will be half of the grade (20%)
and the final paper will be the other half (20%). The final paper will be graded on the following criteria (out of
100%):

- Clarity and Organization (20%)
  - Is the proposal well-structured and easy to follow? Are sections clearly delineated (e.g., Introduction, Methods,
    Predicted Results, Discussion)?
  - Does the writing clearly convey the research idea and its significance?
- Literature Review and Background (20%)
  - Does the proposal provide a thorough and relevant review of the existing literature?
  - Is the research question theoretically grounded?
- Research Design and Methodology (30%)
  - Are the proposed experiment(s) well-designed and feasible?
  - Are the methods described in sufficient detail to carry out the study?
  - Are potential confounds or limitations addressed?
- Predicted Results (10%)
  - Are the predicted results consistent with the research question?
  - Is the proposed analysis plan appropriate?
  - If there are visualizations included, do they effectively communicate the predicted results?
- Significance and Innovation (10%)
  - Does the proposal highlight the importance and potential impact of the research?
  - Is the research idea original or does it build meaningfully on the prior work referenced in the literature review?
- Connection to Python Implementation (10%)
  - Does the proposal clearly map onto the code project? E.g., if the proposal is for a particular eye-tracking
    experiment, does the code project implement that eye-tracking experiment as described?
  - Are the tools, libraries, or methods correctly referenced in the proposal?

### Participation and Attendance — 10%

Participation and attendance is 10% of your grade. This includes being present for lab, participating in discussions,
and coming to office hours.

### Bonus Points for Final Project — up to 2% (plus possible extension)

You will have two opportunities to earn bonus points for your final projects, both related to peer review. You will
receive 1 point of extra credit for submitting the project early in order to solicit peer feedback. Additionally, you
will receive 1 more point of extra credit if you provide peer feedback to at least two other randomly selected projects
from the class. Lastly, anyone who completes _both_ of these tasks will receive an automatic extension of the final
project due date until May 19th.

### Bonus Points for Course Feedback — up to 2%

I will solicit anonymous, honest feedback from you throughout the semester, both formally and informally. In order to
incentivize your participation, I am offering a collective reward for the class — an additional 2% toward _all_ of your
final grades — under one condition. **I will distribute this bonus to the whole class if, and only if, at least 75% of
the class submits feedback for the course.** If less than 75% of the class participates, then no one receives any bonus
(so submitting feedback can only help you, and can never hurt you). It is important to me that you are honest in this
feedback. This bonus is a class-wide incentive to help develop the course, its content, my own abilities as an
instructor, and to generally improve the course for everyone, including future students.

## 4. Academic Integrity Policy

This class will take the University's Academic Integrity policy very seriously. Cheating and other forms of academic
dishonesty will not be tolerated. The University of Illinois has the responsibility of maintaining academic integrity so
as to protect the quality of education and research on our campus and to protect those who depend upon our integrity. It
is the responsibility of each student to refrain from infractions of academic integrity, from conduct that may lead to
suspicion of such infractions, and from conduct that aids others in such infractions. It is also the responsibility of
the student to know and understand what constitutes academic integrity infractions. Ignorance is not a valid excuse. The
University's official statement of a student's responsibilities can be found here:
[https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-401](https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-401). More
information about the University's academic integrity policy, and what constitutes an infraction, can be found here:
[https://www.las.illinois.edu/students/integrity/](https://www.las.illinois.edu/students/integrity/).

### AI Policy

It is becoming increasingly common for programmers to use AI tools to help them write code. This is not so dangerous for
an experienced coder who (hopefully) understands both the benefits and dangers of these tools. However, it is likely
outright harmful for a beginner who is just learning how to program. Imagine trying to learn how to ride a bicycle for
the first time, but instead of struggling with an actual bicycle, falling, getting bruised, developing a sense of
balance, etc., you're instead "training" by sitting on a self-driving tricycle with unreliable GPS and a tendency to go
off-road. I am especially concerned by how these tools can reduce one's ability to debug program behavior and think
critically about whether the code you are writing accomplishes your goals correctly.

While I don't want to discourage you from using AI assistants writ large, I do want you to be transparent and thoughtful
in your use of such tools. So, I ask that you keep in mind the distinction between "learning" vs. "doing" as you go
through this course:

- You may use AI tools to help you _learn_ how to program. For example, you can ask large language models (LLMs, like
  ChatGPT) to explain core coding concepts to you in ways that you might find digestible, or to help you understand why
  your code threw a particular error. One such tool is Harvard's CS50 class's [Rubber Duck Debugging
  AI](https://cs50.ai/chat). The virtual duck asks questions to help you understand what's going on in your code (a la
  ["Rubber Duck Debugging"](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/)). It is unlikely to hamper your learning and may even
  help.
- You may _not_ use AI tools to _do_ (or complete) any of your assignments. This means that you mustn't ask a chatbot to
  write code for you (e.g., "Write me a function that returns the sum of squares of a list of numbers") and you mustn't
  copy and paste code directly from a large language model or other AI system into an assignment as your own.

**Transparency requirement**: If you do use AI tools to help you learn, I ask that you please be transparent about it. For example, if you use a
chatbot to help you understand a concept, you might write at the top of your code something like:

> I used ChatGPT to help me understand recursion. Here is the conversation that I had:
> [Insert link to conversation or summary of conversation here]

If, however, you fail to be transparent in your use of the tools, or use an AI tool to literally _do_ your assignments
for you, then you will have violated the academic integrity policy. Such violations will result in a grade of zero for
the relevant assignment and may be referred to the University's academic integrity office for further review.

## 5. Accommodation Policy

To obtain disability-related academic adjustments and/or auxiliary aids, students with disabilities must contact the
course instructor and the Disability Resources and Educational Services (DRES) as soon as possible. To contact DRES, you
may visit 1207 S. Oak St., Champaign, call 333-4603, e-mail disability@illinois.edu, or go to the DRES website
([https://www.disability.illinois.edu](https://www.disability.illinois.edu)). If you are concerned you have a
disability-related condition that is impacting your academic progress, there are academic screening appointments
available on campus that can help diagnose a previously undiagnosed disability by visiting the DRES website and
selecting "Sign-Up for an Academic Screening" at the bottom of the page.
